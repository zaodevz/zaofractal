# ZAOfractal

**Live site: [zaofractal.vercel.app](https://zaofractal.vercel.app)** (canonical domain `fractal.thezao.com` pending DNS).

Home of **ZAO Fractal** - the weekly Respect Game that has run unbroken on Mondays at 6pm EST since around August 2024. It is the only music-focused fractal in existence, the only active fractal on Optimism, and one of two on the Ethereum Superchain.

## What is a fractal?

A fractal is a small-group consensus meeting that distributes a soulbound reputation token (Respect) to participants based on how their peers rank their recent contribution. Repeat weekly. Governance weight comes from contribution, not capital.

The idea was formalized by Daniel Larimer in *More Equal Animals* (Feb 20, 2021) and the Fractally protocol (Jan 28, 2022). Eden Fractal proved it could run for years. Optimism Fractal brought it to Ethereum. ZAO Fractal is the first to apply it to music.
