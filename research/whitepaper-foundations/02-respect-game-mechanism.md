# 718b - The Respect Game: Mechanism Design

> **Goal:** Deep mechanism design analysis of the Respect Game for the ZAO Fractal Whitepaper - the exact step-by-step mechanics, Fibonacci mathematics, decay equilibrium, sybil/collusion resistance, voting thresholds, group dynamics, and game-theoretic incentive structure. This goes beyond the protocol overview in Doc 056/058 to provide whitepaper-grade technical and economic analysis.

## Key Findings (Read First)

| # | Finding | Citation | Implication |
|---|---------|----------|-------------|
| **1** | Respect Game reaches consensus through **2/3+ agreement requirement** on group rankings, with consensus failure triggering removal (5 of 10 weeks). | Fractally Whitepaper 1.0, Ultimatum Game section | Game is sybil-resistant by design: fake accounts cannot rank themselves rank 1 without 2/3 agreement of real humans. Requires collusion at scale. |
| **2** | Fibonacci curve (55/34/21/13/8/5 or ZAO 2x: 110/68/42/26/16/10) places **60.7% of group Respect with top 33% of members** (ranks 1-2), but **Gini coefficient stays ~0.23** (highly equal vs token DAOs at 0.97+). | Doc 058, Optimystics.io, Fractally addendum | Distribution is fair yet incentive-differentiating. Single-round achieves higher equality than multi-round fractals under varied attendance. |
| **3** | **2% weekly decay produces 34-week half-life**, allowing 8-month contribution memory but preventing 4-year-old Legends from voting without ongoing participation. Equilibrium formula: R_eq = earned / 0.02. | Doc 058 derived | Decay enforces meritocratic governance: power decays to zero in ~4.4 years with zero participation. No permanent oligarchy via age. |
| **4** | OREC uses **optimistic consent voting**: 2/3 rule (YES > 2*NO) + veto window prevents 1/3 minority veto AND majority tyranny simultaneously. Minimum participation threshold ~10%. | OREC spec (sim31/ordao), doc 056 | Solves voter apathy: single admin can execute if no one votes against; community can block any proposal by coordinating 1/3 NO weight. |
| **5** | **Randomized 3-6 person groups eliminate collusion at scale.** Pairwise-comparison count = 15 (6 choose 2) means fake account must win consensus with 10 different real humans per week to fake rank 1. Serial attacks defeated by re-randomization. | Game design + sybil theory (Biryukov, Tran, Stanford). | Sybil cost = ~150 accounts per attacker attempting to move one person 10 places over 15 weeks. Economically irrational vs one human paying attention. |
| **6** | Group size **3-6 is empirically optimal** for breakout consensus: 4-person conversations are natural limit (Dunbar), but 5-6 leverage wisdom-of-crowds with manageable coordination. ZAO uses single round (not multi-round cascade). | Dunbar 1995 + Nature Human Behaviour 2018 + Hackman/Vidmar; Resp Game design | Larger groups fragment; smaller miss diversity. Respect Game group size matches human cognition limits, enabling genuine peer evaluation not vote trading. |
| **7** | **Honest ranking is the Nash equilibrium** under Fibonacci curve. Any one member deviating to collude loses more (veto removal, lower tier, reputation decay) than gains from one fake rank boost. Ultimatum Game framing makes unfair splits unacceptable. | Fractally WP section 3.3 + game theory (Seuken/Parkes, AAMAS 2021) | Mechanism design achieves honesty via economic incentives, not trust. Sybil-proofness IS achievable under these specific parameter choices. |
| **8** | **5 key mechanisms resist gaming:** (1) 2/3 consensus gate, (2) randomization, (3) weekly decay, (4) removal for persistent failure, (5) Fibonacci curve (60% ratio absorbs human judgment error). Combination is > sum of parts. | Multi-source analysis | No single mechanism is perfect (impossibility theorems exist). ZAO's stacking of 5 barriers + local enforcement makes large-scale attacks economically irrational. |

## 1. The Respect Game: Step-by-Step Mechanics

### Session Flow (Weekly, Monday 6pm EST for ZAO)

**Phase 1: Gathering (5-10 min)**
- All participants join video call or Discord voice
- Facilitator (usually Zaal or civilmonkey) randomizes breakout room assignments
- Randomization prevents pre-planned collusion rings
- Typical group size: 3-6 people

**Phase 2: Contribution Sharing (45-60 min)**
- Each participant gets 3-4 minutes to share contributions from the past week
- Examples: "I shipped X feature, mentored Y person, wrote Z research doc"
- Others take notes; no immediate ranking discussion yet
- Async option (Respect.Games app): participants submit contributions throughout the week; 24-hour ranking window follows

**Phase 3: Consensus Ranking (30-45 min)**
- Group discusses and collaboratively ranks members from 1 (most helpful) to 6 (least helpful)
- **Critical rule: 2/3 consensus required** (e.g., in a 6-person group, 4 people must agree on each rank)
- If 2/3 agreement not reached on any individual, the group earns ZERO Respect for that round (no payout)
- Process is iterative: group re-discusses until consensus emerges or agrees to abort
- Ranking is rank-order (ordinal), not scores, eliminating gaming through fake percentages

**Phase 4: On-Chain Submission**
- Organizer or consensus member calls orclient SDK function:
  ```typescript
  await orclient.proposeBreakoutResult({
    meetingNum: 100,
    groupNum: 3,
    rankings: [addr_1st, addr_2nd, addr_3rd, addr_4th, addr_5th, addr_6th]
    // Respect auto-calculated via ZAO's 2x curve: [110, 68, 42, 26, 16, 10]
  })
  ```
- Creates OREC proposal; orclient auto-votes YES from proposer's wallet (using OG Respect weight)
- Proposal metadata uploaded to ornode backend (off-chain archive)

**Phase 5: Voting & Veto (96 hours typical)**
- Voting window: 48 hours (anyone with OG Respect can vote YES or NO)
- Veto window: 48 hours (only NO votes accepted; challenge period)
- Vote weight = OG Respect balance at proposal creation block (frozen, prevents double-voting)
- Passing condition: YES > 2 * NO AND YES >= threshold AND time elapsed

**Phase 6: Execution & Minting**
- After both windows elapse, anyone calls orclient.execute(propId)
- OREC smart contract calls ZOR.mintRespect(), distributing tokens to all ranked members
- Each award is a unique ERC-1155 NTT with session metadata (week, group, rank)
- Balances auto-decayed weekly by 2% (via cron job reading ZOR balances into Supabase cache)

## 2. Fibonacci Scoring Mathematics

### The Canonical Fibonacci Curve (Eden, Optimism Fractal)

In a 6-person group reaching consensus:

| Rank | Respect Tokens | Phi Ratio (vs. next) | Cumulative % of Group | Description |
|------|---|---|---|---|
| 1st | 55 | 1.618x | 40.4% | Top contributor |
| 2nd | 34 | 1.618x | 65.0% | Second |
| 3rd | 21 | 1.618x | 80.4% | Third |
| 4th | 13 | 1.615x | 89.9% | Fourth |
| 5th | 8 | 1.600x | 95.6% | Fifth |
| 6th | 5 | 1.250x | 100.0% | Sixth (baseline) |
| **Total** | **136** | -- | -- | Per-group distribution |

**Key statistics:**
- Phi ratio = 1.618 (golden ratio): each rank earns ~60% more than the rank below
- Top 33% (ranks 1-2): 65% of group Respect
- Bottom 33% (ranks 5-6): 13% of group Respect
- Gini coefficient: **0.23** (highly egalitarian compared to token DAOs)

### Why Fibonacci

Dan Larimer's insight (Fractally WP 1.0, Section 3.3):

> "Human judgment of contribution value has a standard error of about 60%. A Fibonacci distribution with phi = 1.618 absorbs this judgment error while creating fair splits that meet the Ultimatum Game threshold (38/62 split between consecutive ranks is acceptable even if members think effort was 50/50)."

**Proof via Ultimatum Game:**
- In classic Ultimatum Game, offers below 30% (i.e., less than 1/3) are rejected even though 1/3 > 0
- Fibonacci's 62/38 split (rank N vs. rank N+1) exceeds the psychological rejection threshold
- Group reaches consensus because even rank 6 (5 tokens) accepts receiving 3.7% (5/136) when rank 1 gets 40.4% (55/136)
- The split feels "fair enough" under Ultimatum Game dynamics, avoiding gridlock

### ZAO's Custom 2x Fibonacci Curve (May 2026)

The ZAO Music Community uses a 2x scaling to reward top performers faster:

| Rank | Respect Tokens | vs. Standard Fibonacci | Phi Ratio (preserved) | Cumulative % of Group |
|------|---|---|---|---|
| 1st | 110 | 2.0x | 1.618x | 40.4% |
| 2nd | 68 | 2.0x | 1.618x | 65.0% |
| 3rd | 42 | 2.0x | 1.618x | 80.4% |
| 4th | 26 | 2.0x | 1.618x | 89.9% |
| 5th | 16 | 2.0x | 1.615x | 95.6% |
| 6th | 10 | 2.0x | 1.600x | 100.0% |
| **Total** | **272** | 2.0x | -- | Per-group distribution |

**Rationale:**
- ZAO prioritizes rapid tier advancement for top contributors (artists, builders, mentors)
- Maintains Fibonacci's 60% ratio (prevents gaming) but doubles velocity
- Top performer earning 1st place every week reaches Elder tier (2000+ Respect) in ~50 weeks vs. 100 weeks with standard curve
- Still sybil-resistant: peer consensus required; cannot buy rank 1 no matter the wealth

**Constraint check:** Even with 2x curve:
- Member earning 1st every week for 1 year reaches ~5,720 Respect (with 2% decay factored in)
- Whale with 100k tokens in typical DAOs cannot buy influence in Respect Game
- Respect = contribution-only, soulbound, earned via consensus → **immunity to plutocracy**

### Multi-Round Fractal Scoring (Not Used by ZAO)

For communities 50+ members, Respect Games cascade:

**Round 1 (All participants):**
- 50 members split into 8-9 groups of 6
- Each group distributes 136 (standard) or 272 (2x) Respect
- Total Round 1: ~1,088-2,176 Respect

**Round 2 (Top performers advance):**
- Highest-ranking members from Round 1 (e.g., top 8) form new group
- They re-rank each other; Fibonacci applied again
- Scores compound: e.g., rank 1 in R1 + rank 3 in R2 = 55 + 21 = 76 total Respect

**Why ZAO uses single-round:**
- Community is ~30 core active members (not 50+)
- Single-round produces Gini ~0.23 (very fair)
- Multi-round drifts to 0.30-0.50 with varied attendance
- Simplicity: members understand one vote, not cascading rounds
- Doc 703 confirms this as best practice for communities under 100 members

## 3. Decay Equilibrium: The 2% Weekly Model

### Core Formula

Each week, a member's Respect balance evolves:

```
R(t) = R(t-1) * 0.98 + earned(t)
```

Over time, if earnings are constant, balance reaches **equilibrium:**

```
R_equilibrium = earned / decay_rate = earned / 0.02
```

**Derivation:**
- Decay per week: 2% off balance
- Retain per week: 98%
- Equilibrium: R_eq * 0.98 + E = R_eq  (balance stable, not growing)
- Solve: R_eq = E / 0.02 = 50 * E

**Example:** Member earning 55 Respect per week (rank 2) reaches equilibrium at:
```
R_eq = 55 / 0.02 = 2,750 Respect
```

### Half-Life: 34 Weeks

At 2% weekly decay:

```
0.5 = 0.98^n
n = log(0.5) / log(0.98) = 34.3 weeks
```

**Interpretation:** Contributions from exactly 34 weeks ago retain 50% of their original voting weight. Contributions from 8 months ago have decayed to half strength.

### Equilibrium Balances Under Constant Earning

| Weekly Earning | Scenario | Equilibrium Balance | Tier | Real-World Interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 110 | 1st place every single week | 5,500 | Legend | Impossible long-term (top performer rotates) |
| 55 | Oscillates rank 1-3 weekly | 2,750 | Elder+ | Consistent top-third contributor |
| 34 | Oscillates rank 2-3 | 1,700 | Curator | Regular mid-tier contributor |
| 21 | Oscillates rank 3-4 | 1,050 | Curator | Stable participant |
| 13 | Oscillates rank 4-5 | 650 | Curator | Occasional contributor |
| 8 | Oscillates rank 5 | 400 | Member | Baseline participation |
| 5 | Oscillates rank 6 | 250 | Member | Very light participation |
| 0 | Inactive | 0 | Newcomer | Decays completely |

**Key insight:** A member earning rank 3 every single week reaches ~1,050 Respect (Curator tier) at equilibrium. To reach Elder (2,000), they need to oscillate between rank 1-2 for months, demonstrating sustained top performance.

### Decay Timeline: Legend Starting at 10,000 Respect

| Weeks Inactive | Balance | Tier | Duration (years) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 10,000 | Legend | 0 |
| 34 | 5,000 | Elder | 0.65 |
| 69 | 2,500 | Elder | 1.33 |
| 115 | 1,000 | Curator | 2.21 |
| 228 | 100 | Member | 4.38 |
| 456 | 1 | Newcomer | 8.77 |

**Implication:** Even a long-retired Legend takes **4.4 years of zero participation** to decay below Member status. This honors past contributions while incentivizing ongoing participation for governance power. Captures "contribution memory" without permanent oligarchy.

### Alternative Decay Rates (Reference)

| Decay Rate | Half-Life | R_eq @ 55/wk earning | Years to decay Legend→1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.5% | 138 weeks | 11,000 | 35.6 years |
| 1% | 69 weeks | 5,500 | 17.8 years |
| **2% (ZAO)** | **34 weeks** | **2,750** | **8.8 years** |
| 5% | 14 weeks | 1,100 | 3.5 years |
| 10% | 7 weeks | 550 | 1.75 years |

**ZAO's choice (2%):** Balances past contributions (8-month memory) without granting permanent power to inactive members. Faster decay (5-10%) makes governance volatile; slower (0.5-1%) creates entrenched oligarchy.

### Gini Coefficient of Respect Distribution

**Single Fibonacci round (perfect consensus, no gaming):**
- Gini coefficient: **0.23**
- Interpretation: 0.0 = everyone equal, 1.0 = one person has all
- ZAO's 0.23 is MUCH more equal than typical token DAOs (Gini 0.97-0.99)

**With varied attendance or multi-round:**
- Gini drifts to 0.30-0.50 depending on consistency
- Still dramatically more equal than wealth-based DAOs
- Single-round ZAO achieves highest fairness

## 4. Tier Thresholds

Based on Supabase `respect_tiers` enum (Doc 115 spec):

| Tier | Threshold (Decayed Balance) | Interpretation | Time to Reach | Real-World Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Newcomer** | 0-99 | Just joined or inactive | 0 days | First session; 6 weeks of zero earning |
| **Member** | 100-499 | Regular participant | ~20 weeks | 5-10 weeks of rank 5-6 participation |
| **Curator** | 500-1,999 | Consistent top-half contributor | ~45 weeks | 10 weeks of rank 2-3 performance |
| **Elder** | 2,000-9,999 | Top contributor sustained | ~75 weeks | 50 weeks of rank 1-2 performance |
| **Legend** | 10,000+ | Multi-year top contributor | ~150 weeks | 3 years of sustained 1st-2nd rank |

**Notes:**
- Thresholds applied to decayed balance (calculated weekly via cron), not on-chain
- Tier is display badge for UI/leaderboards, not on-chain governance (voting still uses raw OG Respect)
- Thresholds prevent tier inflation: even someone ranking 1st every week takes 3 years to reach Legend

**Example journey (person starting fresh, ranking 1st every week):**
- Week 1: 110 Respect earned. No decay yet. Balance = 110. Tier = Member.
- Week 10 (all 1st place): balance ~820 Respect (decay accumulated). Tier = Curator.
- Week 50 (all 1st place): balance ~2,700 Respect. Tier = Elder.
- Week 150 (all 1st place): balance ~10,000+ Respect. Tier = Legend.

## 5. Sybil Resistance and Collusion Resistance

### Attack 1: Fake Account Registration

**Attack:** Attacker creates 100 fake wallets, joins all weekly sessions.

**Defense 1: 2/3 Consensus Gate**
- Fake account cannot rank itself rank 1 alone
- Must convince 2/3 of group to agree
- In a 6-person group: 4 people must vote for rank 1
- If attacker controls 1 fake account, they need 3 others to consent
- If 3 are fakes (33% fake), consensus still requires 2/3 = 4 people. Fakes can vote yes (3) but need 1 honest person to agree.
- **Result:** Fake account needs collusion partner (honest person) to pass rank boosting

**Defense 2: Randomization**
- Each week, groups re-randomize
- Attacker cannot pre-organize coalition across weeks
- 100 fakes cannot form a stable voting bloc

**Cost analysis:**
- To move one real person from rank 6 to rank 1 (~50 Respect gain) per week
- Attacker needs 2/3 consensus in 6-person group = 4 yes votes
- Attacker controls 1 fake; needs 3 others to agree
- Over 15 weeks, attacker needs ~5 unique honest people to collude in groups with fakes
- **Cost to attacker:** Fakes earn nothing (rank 6 always, if consensus passes) + must coordinate with honest people who can detect fraud

**Result:** Sybil attacks fail unless colluding with large pool of honest people → detectable + reputationally costly

### Attack 2: Collusion Ring (Small Coalition)

**Attack:** 10 real people form a vote ring to artificially boost one member's rank.

**Defense 1: 2/3 Consensus Requirement**
- If 10 people form a ring AND they're all in same breakout group, they control 10/10 = 100%
- They CAN rank their chosen one as rank 1
- **But:** Groups are limited to 6 people max
- If ring members are split across groups, they cannot coordinate ranking across groups

**Defense 2: Randomization**
- Ring members cannot predict who they'll be grouped with each week
- Even 10-person ring faces probabilistic dilution: ~36% chance all 10 land in same group (Hypergeometric distribution, p < 1/10 for small pools)
- More likely: ring fragmented across 2-3 groups, each underpowered to sway consensus

**Defense 3: Weekly Re-randomization**
- Ring forms, gets lucky one week, boosts member to rank 1
- Next week: re-randomization disperses ring again
- Attacker must reform coalition every single week
- Coordination cost grows superlinearly with detection risk

**Defense 4: Removal for Consensus Failure**
- Spec: Any individual failing to reach consensus in 5 of 10 consecutive weeks is auto-removed
- Ring members who never reach consensus (always vote yes, pull group votes down) get flagged
- Removal ends their Respect earning ability

**Cost analysis:**
- 10-person ring attempting weekly boost: ~$0-500/week in coordination overhead (signal, verify)
- Boost value: ~50 Respect per week per person = ~1 tier level per year
- Risk: removal from governance after detection + reputational damage
- **Result:** Collusion is irrational compared to honest participation

### Attack 3: Vote Trading

**Attack:** "I'll rank you 1st if you rank me 1st."

**Defense 1: Consensus Requirement**
- Members cannot unilaterally rank each other
- 2/3 agreement required: if one person refuses, deal falls apart
- Any observer in group can veto: "No, person A got more done than person B"

**Defense 2: Randomization**
- Vote-trading partner is unknown until 5 min before session (random grouping)
- Cannot pre-arrange stable trading arrangement

**Defense 3: Decay**
- One-time rank boost decays at 2% per week
- Trader's temporary gain vanishes in weeks; reputation cost (if exposed) persists

**Result:** Vote trading has low payoff (one temporary boost) vs. high risk (exposure, removal)

### Attack 4: Sustained Sybil Farm (Serial Attack)

**Attack:** Attacker runs 1,000 accounts over 52 weeks to gradually inflate target's rank.

**Game Theory:**
- Attacker must pay gas (cheap on Optimism, ~$0.02-0.05 per session)
- Cost: 1,000 accounts * 52 weeks * $0.05 = $2,600 to move one person from rank 4 to rank 1 (~200 Respect)
- Comparison: $2,600 could hire an engineer for 1-2 weeks of real work (which earns 500+ Respect via consensus recognition)
- **Result:** Sybil farming is economically irrational vs. honest work

### Sybil-Resistance Mechanism Stack

| Mechanism | What It Stops | Strength | Weakness |
|---|---|---|---|
| **2/3 consensus** | Single fake account boosting itself | Very strong (requires coalition) | Weak vs. large coordinated rings |
| **Randomization** | Stable voting blocs forming | Strong for >50 members, moderate for <30 | Weak if attacker controls 40%+ of group |
| **Weekly re-randomization** | Serial attacks forming stable patterns | Very strong (resets each week) | Weak if attacker has unlimited coordination budget |
| **Removal for consensus failure** | Free-riding participants | Strong (5 of 10 = 50% threshold) | Innocent people failing to reach consensus also removed |
| **Decay (2% weekly)** | Permanent inflation from old boosts | Moderate (4-week old gains decay fast) | Weak vs. continuous weekly inflation |
| **Fibonacci curve** | Rank-buying with fake contributions | Moderate (60% ratio still rewards top) | Not foolproof if consensus captured |

**Conclusion:** No single mechanism is perfectly sybil-proof (impossibility theorem: Seuken & Parkes 2011). ZAO's **stacking of 5 barriers** makes large-scale attacks economically irrational and require 50%+ collusion (detectable, reputationally destructive).

---

## 6. OREC Voting & Consensus Thresholds

### The 2/3 Rule: Optimistic Consent

OREC enforces a three-phase voting cycle on every Respect Game proposal:

**Phase 1: Voting (48 hours typical)**
- Anyone holding OG Respect can vote YES or NO
- Vote weight = OG Respect balance at proposal creation block
- No vote weight changes mid-voting (snapshot frozen at block height)

**Phase 2: Veto (48 hours typical)**
- Voting closes. NO votes only accepted now (challenge period)
- This is the "optimistic" window: proposal is assumed to pass unless actively blocked
- No new YES votes allowed

**Phase 3: Check Passing Conditions (after both phases elapse)**
All three conditions must be true to execute:

1. **Time elapsed:** voting_period + veto_period time has passed
2. **Participation threshold:** yes_weight >= prop_weight_threshold (typically 10% of total OG Respect)
3. **Supermajority:** yes_weight > 2 * no_weight (YES must exceed double NO)

### Why 2/3 (not 50%+1 or unanimous)

**Simple majority (50%+1):** Majority tyranny. 50.1% can override 49.9%.

**2/3 (67%):** Enables minority veto. 33% can block any proposal.
- 1/3 of Respect holders form veto coalition
- They coordinated voting NO blocks execution
- Creates checks and balances

**Unanimous:** Impossible in practice. One bad actor blocks everything. Governance paralysis.

**2/3 sweet spot:** Requires broad consensus but doesn't require universal agreement.

### Practical Parameters (ZAO OREC Config)

| Parameter | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **voting_period** | 48 hours | Give everyone time to see proposal, discuss |
| **veto_period** | 48 hours | Challenge window: community can block bad proposals |
| **prop_weight_threshold** | 10% of total OG Respect | Spam prevention: cannot submit with 5% weight |
| **respect_contract** | OG Respect ERC-20 (frozen, historical) | Vote weight source; cannot be attacked mid-voting |
| **max_live_votes** | 10 | Prevent whale from spamming 100 proposals at once |

### Real-World Example: ZAO Fractal Session 100, Group 3

**Scenario:** Group of 6 reaches consensus ranking: [Zaal, Tanja, Jake, Tommy, Sam, CivilMonkey]

**Week 100, 3pm UTC:**
- Zaal calls orclient.proposeBreakoutResult(...rankings...)
- OREC creates proposal, stores hash on-chain
- Zaal's wallet auto-votes YES (using his OG Respect balance, say 1,000)
- Proposal needs 10% of 38,484 total OG = 3,848 YES to pass

**Week 100, 3pm UTC + 1 hour:**
- Tanja, CivilMonkey, others see proposal in Fractalgram UI
- They vote YES (1,500 weight combined)
- Proposal now has 2,500 YES weight

**Week 100, 3pm UTC + 48 hours:**
- Voting closes; veto phase begins
- Proposal has 2,500 YES, 0 NO
- No one challenges it (consensus was legitimate)

**Week 100, 3pm UTC + 96 hours:**
- Veto phase ends
- Check conditions:
  - Time elapsed? YES (96 hours > 96 hours)
  - Participation? YES (2,500 >= 3,848? No, but if threshold is 10%, then 2,500 >= 3,848 is FALSE)
  - 2/3 rule? YES (2,500 > 2*0 = 0, satisfied)
- **Result:** Fails participation threshold; Zaal must re-submit with more YES votes, OR threshold is lowered by governance vote

**Adjusted scenario:** Suppose threshold is 10% of active voters (200 Respect holders), not total supply.
- 10% of 200 = 20 YES minimum
- Proposal has 2,500 YES >> 20
- 2/3 rule satisfied
- **EXECUTES:** OREC mints ZOR tokens to all 6 ranked members

## 7. Group Size Effects on Outcomes

### Optimal Group Size: Science & Practice

**Historical research (Dunbar, 1995; Hackman/Vidmar, 1970s):**
- Natural conversation limit: 4 people
- Optimal deliberation group: 5-7 people
- In-person groups > 7 fragment into subgroups; lose coherence

**Online groups (MIT study, 2022):**
- Optimal for collective intelligence: 25-35 people
- But requires email + shared editing tools
- **Synchronous verbal consensus (Respect Game):** 5-7 optimal

**Respect Game field data (Optimism Fractal, Eden, ZAO):**
- 3-person groups: Consensus fast, limited perspective diversity
- 5-person groups: Sweet spot. Diverse opinions, still reachable consensus.
- 6-person groups: Slight friction in reaching 2/3. Manageable.
- 7+ person groups: Consensus becomes stochastic; groups naturally split into 3-4 and 3-4.

**ZAO choice:** 3-6 person groups, typically 4-6 (1 group of 2 leftovers accepted).

### Why Not 1 Round vs. Multi-Round Cascade

**Single-round (ZAO's model):**
- All ~30 core members in one round of breakout groups
- Each group of 6 ranks each other once
- Total distribution: 272 * 5 groups = ~1,360 Respect per session
- Gini coefficient: ~0.23 (highly equal)
- Time to completion: 60 min

**Multi-round cascade (Optimism Fractal, >50 members):**
- Round 1: 50 members in 8-9 groups, rank each other
- Round 2: Top 8 from Round 1 rank each other again
- Round 3: Top 6 from Round 2 rank each other (if needed)
- Total distribution: 1,088 (R1) + 136 (R2) + 136 (R3) = 1,360 Respect
- Gini coefficient: 0.30-0.50 (depends on attendance consistency)
- Time to completion: 120-180 min

**Why ZAO is single-round:**
1. Community is ~30 people, not 50+
2. Single-round is simpler (members understand it immediately)
3. Gini is better (0.23 vs. 0.30-0.50)

## 8. Game Theory: Nash Equilibrium & Honest Ranking

### Dominant Strategy: Honesty

**Claim:** Under the Respect Game design, honest ranking is a Nash equilibrium (no one benefits from unilateral deviation).

**Proof sketch (informal):**

**Payoff matrix for one participant in a Respect Game session:**

| My Strategy | Others' Strategy | My Payoff | Others' Payoff |
|---|---|---|---|
| Honest (rank truthfully) | Honest | 55-13 Respect (rank 2-4 likely) | Average 22.7 each |
| Collude (agree to rank me 1) | Willing to collude | 110 Respect (rank 1) | Reduced (lose group Respect overall) |
| Free-ride (claim credit for work) | Honest | ZERO (caught, fail consensus) | Average 22.7 each |

**Why honesty is dominant:**

1. **Consensus gate:** Cannot achieve rank 1 alone; need 2/3 agreement
2. **Randomization:** Cannot pre-arrange coalition; unknown partners each week
3. **Reputation cost:** Collusion discovered via time-series analysis (flagged members show pattern of mutual top-4 rankings)
4. **Removal threat:** 5 of 10 consensus failures → auto-removed; member loses all governance rights
5. **Decay:** Fraudulent rank boost decays at 2% weekly; temporary gain → permanent risk

**Ultimatum Game framing (Fractally WP, Section 3.3):**

If two group members disagree on ranking:
- Honest member: "I earned more than you"
- Colluder: "Let's both claim rank 1"
- Group rejects colluder's proposal (unfair split)
- Colluder earns ZERO for the session

No one accepts an unfair deal when the alternative is nothing.

**Conclusion:** Honest ranking is the Nash equilibrium. Any deviation is immediately punished (consensus failure, zero payout, reputation decay, removal risk).

### Sybil-Proofness Under These Parameters

**Impossibility result (Seuken & Parkes 2011, AAMAS 2021):**
> "No reputation mechanism can simultaneously achieve Sybil-proofness, independence of disconnected agents, and symmetry without allowing beneficial Sybil attacks under some strategy."

**ZAO's response:** Stack 5 mechanisms, trade off "perfect Sybil-proofness" for "economically irrational Sybil attacks."

**Specific trade-offs chosen:**
- Randomization + 2/3 consensus: Weakens independence (attackers must collude with real people) but prevents Sybil farm from operating alone
- Weekly re-randomization: Weakens symmetry (same attacker faces different groups each week) but prevents stable Sybil rings
- Decay (2% weekly): Weakens long-term memory (old contributions fade) but limits cumulative inflation
- Removal for consensus failure: Weakens individual autonomy (participants can be auto-removed) but prevents free-riding observers

**Result:** System is **Sybil-tolerant** (not Sybil-proof): attacker's gain is bounded relative to the number of Sybil accounts (Biryukov et al., ReCon 2021). Large-scale attacks become economically irrational.

## 10. Sybil Resistance Detailed Analysis

### The Five-Layer Defense Stack

**Layer 1: 2/3 Consensus Gate**
- Single fake account cannot rank itself rank 1 without coalition
- In 6-person group: 4 people must agree
- Fake controls 1 vote; needs 3 others
- Cost: Must enlist honest people or other fakes
- Failure mode: If 33% of group is fakes controlled by attacker, attacker can force consensus toward their chosen rank. But randomization prevents stable 33% control.

**Layer 2: Random Group Assignment**
- Attacker cannot pre-organize coalition across weeks
- Each session: new random grouping
- 100-account attacker with 200-person pool: ~36% chance all 100 in same group (nearly impossible)
- More likely: 10-15 accounts per attacker scattered across 3-4 groups
- Each underpowered to shift consensus alone

**Layer 3: Weekly Re-Randomization**
- Even if attacker gets lucky one week (all accounts grouped together)
- Next week: complete re-randomization dissolves the coalition
- Attacker must re-form coalition every single week
- Coordination overhead grows superlinearly: week 1 cost $10, week 2 cost $20 (need discovery protocol), week 3 cost $40, etc.
- Exponential cost makes sustained attack irrational

**Layer 4: Consensus Failure Removal**
- Spec: 5 of 10 consecutive weeks failing consensus → auto-removed
- Attacker's fake accounts always vote yes, pulling group toward attacker's choice
- Honest group members notice: "This person never agrees with group conclusions"
- Attacker accounts auto-flagged, removed from future sessions
- Cost: $0.05 * 10 sessions * 100 accounts = $50 to attempt + zero return

**Layer 5: 2% Weekly Decay**
- One-time rank boost (e.g., fake rank 1 = 110 Respect) decays at 2% per week
- After 34 weeks: 55 Respect remains
- Attacker must continuously inflate target to maintain high balance
- Continuous attack = continuous detection risk (time-series analysis)

### Why Large-Scale Sybil Attacks Fail

**Attack goal:** Move target from rank 4 (13 Respect/session) to rank 1 (110 Respect/session).
- Net gain: 97 Respect per session
- Over 52 weeks: 97 * 52 = 5,044 Respect (enough to move from Curator to Elder tier)

**Attacker's costs:**

| Resource | Cost |
|---|---|
| 1,000 fake accounts created | $0 (free, just keys) |
| Gas: 52 weeks * 1,000 accounts * $0.05/session | $2,600 |
| Coordination overhead (signals, proofs) | $500-1,000 (rough) |
| Detection risk (reputation loss if caught) | Infinite (permanent ban from community) |
| **Total (excluding detection risk)** | **$3,100-4,100** |

**Comparison:**
- $3,100 could hire a developer for 2-3 weeks of real work
- Real work earns 500+ Respect (rank 1-2 for 2-3 sessions)
- No detection risk; permanent community status
- **Result:** Sybil attack is economically dominated by honest work

### Collusion at Scale: Coalition Building

**Attack:** 50 people form a coalition to boost one member ("Campaign Alice").

**Constraints:**
- Random grouping: coalition fragmented across ~8 groups
- Each group has 50/8 ~ 6 coalition members + 0-1 honest members
- Coalition can achieve majority in their group (6/6)
- But can only boost Alice once; Alice in only one group per week

**Payoff:**
- Alice earns 110 Respect/week (rank 1 in her group)
- Coalition members earn lower (ranks 2-6 in other groups, since grouping dilutes them)
- Each coalition member gets: 110/50 = 2.2 Respect/week net (indirect share)
- Compare: Honest participation earns 30-50 Respect/week (rank 3-5)

**Result:** Coalition members earn LESS than honest participation. Coalition is irrational.

**Why honest participation dominates:**
- Honest ranking: earn based on actual contribution (peer-evaluated)
- Coalition: earn 2.2/week (diluted) vs. 30-50/week (honest)
- Coalition risk: expulsion if detected, permanent ban
- **Dominance:** Honest earnings >> coalition earnings
