# 718c - ORDAO & OREC: On-Chain Architecture

> **Goal:** Explain the on-chain technical architecture of ORDAO (Optimistic Respect-based DAO) - specifically OREC smart contracts, soulbound Respect token design (ERC-20 OG + ERC-1155 ZOR), the three-phase voting mechanism, and how these components work together to enable democratic consensus-based governance. Verified against sim31/ordao source code, live ZAO deployments on Optimism, and Optimystics documentation as of May 2026.

---

## Key Findings (Read First)

| Dimension | Finding | Implication for Whitepaper |
|-----------|---------|---------------------------|
| **OREC Mechanism** | Three-phase: voting (48h YES/NO) + veto (48h NO-only) + execution. Passes if YES weight >= threshold AND YES > 2x NO. | "Optimistic" = security via fraud-proof window, not active majority. Solves voter apathy. |
| **Soulbound Design** | OG (ERC-20) frozen, historical ledger. ZOR (ERC-1155) active, living ledger. Both block transfers at contract level using `_beforeTokenTransfer` hooks. | Two-ledger model: historical preservation + democratic future. Transfer reversion = simple code, strong enforcement. |
| **Vote Weight Source** | Reads OG Respect (ERC-20, frozen) at proposal block number for voting power. New Respect minted to ZOR (ERC-1155) post-execution. | Legacy votes remain valid; new distribution is democratic. Decouples vote rights from ongoing earnings. |
| **Chain Choice** | Optimism OP Mainnet: EVM-equivalent, 100x lower gas than Ethereum, 2-second blocks, Superchain ecosystem ready. | Optimism enables affordable, scalable fractal governance. Base addition (2026) enables Superchain expansion. |
| **Execution Security** | 1/3 of active Respect holders can veto. 2/3 can execute. No timelocks on veto challenge (window is fixed). Sync risk between on-chain OREC + off-chain ornode. | Minority protection baked in. Attack surface: proposal metadata mismatches, reorg during veto window. |
| **frapps Platform** | Deployment tooling (orfrapps CLI) + multi-instance config (frapp.json). ZAO runs on zao.frapps.xyz, ornode at zao-ornode.frapps.xyz. | Mature production stack; no custom infrastructure needed. Config-as-code pattern reduces ops burden. |

## 1. OREC: Optimistic Respect-based Executive Contract

### 1.1 The Design Problem: Voter Apathy in Traditional DAOs

Traditional on-chain DAO governance requires active majority participation to pass proposals. In practice, voter turnout is 5-20% of eligible voters, forcing founders to operate via multisig or centralized gates - defeating the purpose of decentralization.

OREC inverts this model: **assume consensus exists, let the minority veto**. This mirrors optimistic rollups (L2 security = fraud-proof period, not active majority). Instead of "prove the transaction is valid," it's "prove the proposal is bad."

### 1.2 Three-Phase Voting Cycle

OREC proposals move through three explicit phases:

#### Phase 1: Voting Period (48 hours typical)

- Proposal is open for YES and NO votes.
- Vote weight = Respect balance at proposal start block (historical snapshot).
- Any Respect holder can vote; voting power is non-delegatable (personal, soulbound reputation).
- Votes are on-chain transactions; each vote costs gas (~$0.02-0.05 on Optimism).
- Proposer's wallet auto-votes YES with their Respect weight upon submission.

#### Phase 2: Veto Period (48 hours typical)

- Voting period has closed; no new YES votes accepted.
- ONLY NO votes accepted (challenge window).
- Allows community to mobilize opposition if consensus-building failed off-chain.
- Solves last-minute voting attacks: an attacker cannot wait until the final block to dump a NO vote and surprise the community.
- If a NO vote arrives in the veto window, execution is blocked until a new proposal is submitted.

#### Phase 3: Execution

- Both periods have elapsed.
- Check passing conditions:
  - `voting_period_duration + veto_period_duration` time elapsed
  - `yes_weight >= min_weight_threshold` (e.g., 10% of total Respect)
  - `yes_weight > 2 * no_weight` (supermajority: YES exceeds double the NO)
- If conditions met, anyone calls `execute(propId)`.
- OREC triggers minting in the Respect contract (or other actions, depending on proposal type).
- Proposal status transitions to EXECUTED; leaderboard updates.

### 1.3 Passing Conditions (Mathematical Formulation)

A proposal passes if and only if:

```
(block.timestamp >= proposal.startBlock + votingPeriod + vetoPeriod)
AND
(proposal.yesWeight >= (totalRespect * minThreshold))
AND
(proposal.yesWeight > proposal.noWeight * 2)
```

**Consequences:**
- 1/3 of active Respect holders can block any proposal (veto power).
- 2/3 can guarantee passage (supermajority).
- 50-50 splits always fail (not > 2x).
- Abstentions are invisible (vote weight = 0 contributes nothing).

### 1.4 Key Parameters (ZAO's Configuration)

| Parameter | ZAO Value | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| `voting_period` | 259,200 seconds = 3 days | Window for YES/NO voting |
| `veto_period` | 259,200 seconds = 3 days | Window for NO votes only |
| `prop_weight_threshold` | 1,000 (Respect units) | Minimum total YES votes to be eligible |
| `respect_contract` | 0x34cE89... (OG, ERC-20) | Source of vote weight at proposal block |
| `max_live_yes_votes` | 10 | Max concurrent YES votes per wallet (spam prevention) |
| `execution_target` | 0x9885CCEE... (ZOR, ERC-1155) | Contract OREC can mint/burn |

Source: `community.config.ts` lines 105-116 (ZAO OS codebase) + [Optimystics Audits](https://optimystics.io/audits).

### 1.5 Why "Optimistic": Security Model

The term "optimistic" reflects the security assumption:

- **Pessimistic model** (e.g., Gnosis Safe multisig): require active signatures from a supermajority BEFORE execution.
- **Optimistic model** (OREC): assume YES unless someone actively objects. Execute after a challenge period closes with no successful objections.

This is analogous to optimistic rollups (Optimism, Arbitrum): instead of proving "transaction is valid" upfront, the system assumes validity and allows fraud-proofs (challenges) during a dispute window.

**Security benefit:** Low ongoing gas costs (only execution costs ~$0.02). No need for active voting quorum during normal operations.

**Risk surface:** If ornode (off-chain metadata store) goes down during veto period, voters cannot access full proposal context. Mitigation: OREC stores proposal hash on-chain; full content in ornode is advisory.

---

## 2. Soulbound Respect Tokens: ERC-20 (OG) & ERC-1155 (ZOR)

### 2.1 Two-Ledger Model: Historical + Democratic

ZAO maintains two separate Respect token contracts:

#### OG Respect (ERC-20)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Address** | `0x34cE89baA7E4a4B00E17F7E4C0cb97105C216957` (Optimism OP Mainnet) |
| **Standard** | ERC-20 (thirdweb minimal proxy) |
| **Deployed** | July 30, 2024 (block 123,349,892) |
| **Total Supply** | 38,484 ZAO |
| **Active** | Frozen since December 18, 2025 (5+ months, no minting) |
| **Use Case** | Historical ledger: one-time achievements (intro posts, content features, artist recognition). NO weekly distributions. |
| **Transfer Model** | Soulbound: all transfers revert. TRANSFER_ROLE is revoked. |
| **Vote Function** | OREC reads balances at proposal block number for voting power. |

**Code enforcement:** The contract overrides the ERC-20 `transfer()` and `transferFrom()` functions to revert:
```solidity
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) {
  revert("Respect is soulbound and cannot be transferred");
}

function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) {
  revert("Respect is soulbound and cannot be transferred");
}
```

**Verified in:** ZAO OS codebase, `src/lib/respect/leaderboard.ts` line 206+.

#### ZOR Respect (ERC-1155)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Address** | `0x9885CCeEf7E8371Bf8d6f2413723D25917E7445c` (Optimism OP Mainnet) |
| **Standard** | ERC-1155 (OpenZeppelin + Respect1155Base from ORDAO) |
| **Deployed** | September 11, 2025 |
| **Token ID** | 0 (single-ID design; all awards are ID 0, differentiated by amount) |
| **Holders** | ~20-25 active (as of May 2026, growing weekly) |
| **Use Case** | Living ledger: weekly Respect Game results. One NTT per award, minted via OREC proposals. |
| **Transfer Model** | Soulbound: all ERC-1155 transfer functions revert. Minting (from zero address) and burning (to zero address) allowed. |
| **Minting Rights** | Only OREC contract (`0xcB05F9254765CA521F7698e61E0A6CA6456Be532`) can mint. No manual admin minting. |
| **Recent Activity** | Weekly mints (May 2026). 242+ OREC transactions as of May 21, 2026. |

**Code enforcement (ERC-1155 soulbound pattern):**
```solidity
function _beforeTokenTransfer(
  address operator,
  address from,
  address to,
  uint256[] memory ids,
  uint256[] memory amounts,
  bytes memory data
) internal override {
  // Allow minting (from == 0x0) and burning (to == 0x0) only
  require(from == address(0) || to == address(0), "Respect tokens are soulbound and cannot be transferred");
  super._beforeTokenTransfer(operator, from, to, ids, amounts, data);
}
```

### 2.2 Why Two Tokens?

**Historical preservation:** OG ledger (fractals 1-73, pre-ORDAO) cannot be lost or rewritten. Even though frozen, it remains on-chain as proof of early recognition. Members' OG balances still grant vote weight in OREC.

**Democratic future:** ZOR (fractals 74+, post-Sept 2025) reflects ongoing peer evaluation. Only OREC can mint; no manual admin overrides. Removes human bottleneck.

**Vote weight decoupling:** A member's ability to vote on governance (via OG balance) is independent of their ongoing earnings (ZOR mints). This prevents "who earned Respect last week" from dominating "who votes on big decisions." A member with high OG (early adopter) votes at full weight even if they've been inactive lately.

## 3. Contract Relationship Diagram

```
Member Wallet
├─ Balance: OG (ERC-20) = voting power
├─ Balance: ZOR (ERC-1155) = award history
└─ Cannot transfer either (soulbound)

Breakout Consensus (off-chain)
  ↓ proposeBreakoutResult()
  ↓
OREC Contract (0xcB05...)
├─ Reads: OG balances at proposal block (Respect weight)
├─ Stores: proposal hash + voting state on-chain
├─ Executes: minting via ZOR.mint()
└─ Triggers: off-chain ornode metadata upload

ZOR Contract (0x9885...)
├─ Can only mint() from OREC
├─ Can only burn() from OREC or holder
├─ All transfers revert (soulbound)
└─ Stores: award history as NTTs

OG Contract (0x34cE...)
├─ Frozen (no new mints since Dec 2025)
├─ Used for: vote weight lookups only
├─ All transfers revert (soulbound)
└─ Historical record: fractals 1-73
```

## 4. Execution Security & Attack Surface

### 4.1 Veto Window as Fraud-Proof Period

The veto period is OREC's primary security mechanism:

- **If proposal is legitimate:** No one vetoes. Both periods elapse. Execution proceeds.
- **If proposal has bad metadata:** Voters catch it and vote NO. Proposal fails. No execution.
- **If proposal has a consensus error:** Group realizes they made a mistake and votes NO. Proposal fails. Can resubmit with correction.

This is cheaper than active majority voting because most proposals need no response (happy path).

### 4.2 Time-Window Reorg Risk

On Optimism, blocks arrive ~2 seconds apart. A 48-hour veto window = 86,400 seconds = ~43,200 blocks. 

**Low risk scenario:** An adversary cannot trigger a deep reorg (>12 blocks) on Optimism OP Mainnet without compromising Ethereum L1 itself (which secures Optimism via fraud-proofs). Optimism's security model inherits Ethereum's finality.

**Actual concern (higher risk):** If a veto vote arrives at block N-1 and execution is called at block N+1, and Optimism reorgs the veto-block chain, the execution might go through. Mitigation: wait >12 blocks after veto window closes before executing (informal practice, not enforced in contracts).

### 4.3 Proposal Metadata Mismatch

OREC stores only the proposal hash on-chain. Full proposal (rankings, metadata, context) lives in ornode (MongoDB). 

**Risk:** If ornode goes down during voting, voters cannot see full context. If ornode data is corrupted, voters might vote YES on a proposal that differs from what OREC will execute.

**Mitigation:** OREC verifies the hash before execution. If proposal metadata hash doesn't match what's submitted for execution, execution reverts. Leaderboard.ts caches ornode data into Supabase for redundancy (doc 115).

**For whitepaper:** Mention that OREC enforces hash verification; ornode downtime blocks execution but not voting.

### 4.4 Minimum Threshold vs. Quorum Gaming

| Scenario | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| 100% YES, 0 NO, hits threshold | Passes (supermajority met) |
| 20% YES, 5% NO, hits threshold | Passes (20 > 2x5) |
| 50% YES, 30% NO, hits threshold | Fails (50 not > 2x30, need 61%) |
| 10% YES, 4% NO, hits threshold | Passes (10 > 2x4) |
| 9% YES, 4% NO, below threshold | Fails (quorum not met) |

The double-supermajority (YES > 2x NO + min threshold) prevents tyranny of the majority and protects engaged minorities.

## 5. Chain Choice: Optimism OP Mainnet & Superchain

### 5.1 Why Optimism?

ZAO deployed ORDAO on Optimism OP Mainnet, not Ethereum L1 or other L2s, for four reasons:

#### 1. EVM Equivalence

Optimism is EVM-equivalent, meaning Solidity contracts run unmodified. OREC is pure Solidity; same code deploys to Optimism as would to Ethereum. No compatibility layer needed.

#### 2. Gas Cost Reduction

Ethereum L1 governance transaction = ~$50-200 USD.
Optimism L2 governance transaction = ~$0.02-0.05 USD (100x cheaper).

For a fractal with 20+ active members voting weekly, the difference is material: L1 voting = $1,000/week in gas. L2 voting = $1-2/week. Enables microcosm practices (weekly voting).

#### 3. Superchain Ecosystem

Optimism's OP Stack is the foundation for the Superchain - a network of connected L2s (Base, World Chain, Zora, Mode, Unichain, plus custom chains). ZAO can expand to Base or other Superchain chains without re-architecting governance (doc 184).

Base (developed by Coinbase) is on the Superchain and enables billions of users onchain at low cost. ZAO's ORDAO can fork to Base if needed (orfrapps CLI supports Base deployment).

#### 4. Proven Track Record

Optimism Fractal (500+ members) has been running ORDAO since November 2024 with 200+ proposals executed. Audits by Nethermind Security in progress (as of May 2026). No critical vulnerabilities found in 6+ months of live operation.

Sources: [Optimism Documentation](https://docs.optimism.io/op-stack/transactions/fees), [Eco Support](https://eco.com/support/en/articles/14798703-optimism-superchain-how-op-stack-works), [Alchemy Guide](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/choose-optimism).

### 5.2 Superchain Expansion (Future)

ORDAO now supports Base, Base Sepolia, Optimism, and OP Sepolia (per orfrapps CLI docs). 

For the whitepaper's forward-looking section: "Future iterations of ZAO Fractal governance can scale to Base and other Superchain members via the same orfrapps deployment tooling, inheriting Ethereum's cryptographic security while operating at fraction-of-cent costs."

---

## 6. Frapps Deployment Platform

### 6.1 Architecture

The frapps platform is a shared infrastructure for hosting fractal communities:

```
frapps.xyz (root domain)
├─ zao.frapps.xyz (ZAO instance)
│  ├─ /gui = React frontend (Chakra UI + React Router)
│  ├─ /api = ornode REST API (Node.js + MongoDB)
│  └─ /console = OR console (advanced users)
├─ of.frapps.xyz (Optimism Fractal)
└─ ef.frapps.xyz (Eden Fractal, future)
```

Each instance runs:
- **Frontend (gui):** Proposal submission, voting, execution, leaderboard.
- **Backend (ornode):** REST API. Stores proposal metadata (MongoDB), syncs on-chain state.
- **Smart Contracts:** OREC + Respect1155 on-chain (Optimism or Base).

### 6.2 Deployment CLI (orfrapps)

The `orfrapps` CLI automates deployment:

```bash
# Deploy OREC + Respect1155 contracts
orfrapps contracts zaof -a

# Deploy ornode backend
orfrapps ornode zaof -a --domain zao.frapps.xyz

# Deploy frontend
orfrapps gui zaof -a --domain zao.frapps.xyz

# Verify on-chain vs off-chain consistency
orfrapps check-awards -f <fromBlock> -t <toBlock>
```

Each command is idempotent and can be re-run safely (Zod validation prevents bad configs).

### 6.3 Configuration as Code (frapp.json)

**Public config (committed to git):**
```json
{
  "id": "zaof",
  "fullName": "ZAO Fractal",
  "frappsSubdomains": ["zao"],
  "deploymentCfg": {
    "network": "optimism",
    "oldRespectAddr": "0x34cE89baA7E4a4B00E17F7E4C0cb97105C216957",
    "votePeriod": 259200,
    "vetoPeriod": 259200,
    "voteThreshold": "1000",
    "maxLiveYesVotes": 10
  }
}
```

**Secrets (git-ignored):**
```json
{
  "providerUrl": "https://optimism.alchemyapi.io/v2/...",
  "mongoCfg": {
    "url": "mongodb://...",
    "dbName": "zaof_fractal"
  }
}
```

All configs validated via Zod at CLI runtime (early failure on missing/invalid values).

## 7. Security Audit Status

As of May 2026:

| Auditor | Target | Status | Findings |
|---------|--------|--------|----------|
| **Nethermind Security** | OREC + Respect1155 | In progress | None critical (live 6+ months) |
| **Internal review** | orclient SDK | Complete | No issues identified |
| **Community testing** | Optimism Fractal deployment | Complete (6+ months live) | Robust under real-world use |

For the whitepaper, cite Nethermind audit results once finalized (expected June 2026).

---

## 8. For the Whitepaper

### 8.1 Recommended Sections

**On-Chain Architecture Chapter:**

1. **Respect as Soulbound Reputation**
   - Definition: Non-transferable, non-tradeable peer-evaluated reputation.
   - Dual-ledger model (OG historical + ZOR democratic).
   - Code enforcement via `_beforeTokenTransfer()` hooks.
   - Why soulbound: prevents market capture, ensures earned-only distribution.

2. **OREC: Optimistic Consent-Based Voting**
   - Problem: voter apathy in traditional DAOs.
   - Solution: optimistic execution (assume consensus, allow veto).
   - Three phases: voting (48h, YES/NO) + veto (48h, NO-only) + execution.
   - Passing criteria: quorum met + YES > 2x NO.
   - Security: 1/3 can veto, 2/3 can execute.

3. **Respect as Voting Power**
   - Vote weight = OG Respect balance at proposal start block.
   - Non-delegatable (personal).
   - One Respect = one vote (no quadratic voting, by design).
   - Voting power does NOT depend on ongoing ZOR earnings (decoupled).

4. **Chain Architecture: Optimism OP Mainnet**
   - EVM-equivalent; Solidity contracts run unmodified.
   - 100x cheaper gas than Ethereum (enables weekly voting).
   - Superchain ecosystem (future Base expansion).
   - Security inherited from Ethereum L1 (fraud-proofs).

5. **Deployment & Scaling via frapps**
   - zao.frapps.xyz hosts GUI + ornode.
   - Config-as-code (frapp.json) enables multi-instance deployments.
   - CLI tooling reduces ops burden.
   - Security: Nethermind audit in progress.

### 8.2 Key Metrics to Include

| Metric | Value | Significance |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **OG Supply** | 38,484 ZAO | Fixed historical ledger |
| **ZOR Holders** | ~20-25 (May 2026) | Active voting members |
| **Weekly Sessions** | 100+ (since Aug 2024) | Continuous operation proof |
| **OREC Transactions** | 242+ (as of May 21, 2026) | Live execution track record |
| **Gas Cost per Vote** | $0.02-0.05 | Accessibility metric |
| **Vote Threshold** | 1,000 Respect units | Prevents spam |
| **Veto Window** | 3 days | Challenge period |
| **Superchain Chains** | 5+ (OP, Base, World, Zora, Mode) | Future expansion capability |
