# Deep Research

The DEEP-tier research layer for the ZAO Fractal repo. Where `/reference/` is the curated survey of the fractal-governance lineage, `/research/` is the source-heavy depth - each file is a hub doc with primary sources, frontmatter, and verdict-first sections.

## Top-level hub docs (01-06)

| # | File | Topic | Lines | Sources |
|---|------|-------|-------|---------|

| 02 | [02-live-communities-deep.md](02-live-communities-deep.md) | Roy Fractal at 700+ scale, Eden Fractal Epoch 2, Aquadac 12-week season, Optimism Fractal pause autopsy | ~400 | 10 |
| 03 | [03-music-cignals-deep.md](03-music-cignals-deep.md) | Cignals, Fractal DJ, music DAOs that tried peer-ranked governance, what changes if ZAO ranks tracks | ~530 | 20 |

## Sub-folders

| Folder | What | When to use |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `whitepaper-foundations/` | Seven sub-docs that feed the 11-chapter ZAO Fractal Whitepaper. Each is a chapter-foundation. | Drafting the whitepaper |
| `primary-sources/` | The canonical ORDAO + Respect mechanics specs (the original DEEP docs every other doc traces back to) | Implementing or reviewing contract behavior |
| `context/` | Adjacent governance frames (Superchain cross-chain, sociocracy circles, plural events) | Writing the comparative chapter or designing sprint adaptations |
| `external/` | Cross-cutting external research, sources beyond the immediate ZAO lineage | Literature reviews, breadth checks |
| `code-walk/` | Annotated walkthroughs of the Discord bot and ORDAO Solidity contracts | Engineering onboarding, security review, fork or extension work |

Total in `/research/`: ~10500 lines, 320+ unique sources. Plus `/whitepaper/draft/` (Ch.1-3 first drafts, ~8200 words) - see [whitepaper/README.md](../whitepaper/README.md).

## How to navigate

- **First time here?** Read this README + the four hub docs (01-04). Then dive into `whitepaper-foundations/` if you are writing the whitepaper.
- **Writing the whitepaper?** `whitepaper-foundations/INDEX.md` maps each sub-doc to a chapter.
- **Implementing contracts?** `primary-sources/INDEX.md`.
- **Comparing fractal vs other governance models?** `context/INDEX.md` + the comparative section of `01-foundations-deep.md`.
- **Need a source we haven't cited?** `external/INDEX.md`.
- **Onboarding a new contributor?** Start them at `/reference/` for the shallow pass. Send them to `/research/` only when they need depth.

## Tier policy

Every file in this folder is DEEP-tier (per the zao-research skill): minimum 10 unique sources per doc, each classified `[FULL]` / `[PARTIAL]` / `[FAILED]`, with at least 3 specific numbers (dates, versions, percentages, addresses) per section. No "consider/might/explore" hedging language - direct verdicts only. Frontmatter on every file. No fabrication - unknown facts marked UNKNOWN.

Re-validate every 4-6 weeks. APIs, contract addresses, and community participation counts churn fast.

## Source provenance

External claims are sourced to primary URLs (Larimer's books, official websites, Medium articles, GitHub repos, governance forums, academic papers). ZAO-internal claims (contract addresses, OREC transaction counts, bot version history, weekly cadence) draw from the ZAO OS V1 research library and on-chain data.

The sub-folders (`whitepaper-foundations/`, `primary-sources/`, `context/`, `external/`) are imported verbatim from the ZAO OS V1 research library (docs 056, 058, 184, 497, 657, 705, 718a-g). They retain their original cross-references to ZAO research doc numbers - follow the trail in the source repo for full lineage.
