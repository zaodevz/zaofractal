# Deep History: EOS and Fractally - The Two Foundations That Failed, But Whose Ideas Survived

## Executive Summary

Two organizations founded the fractal-governance movement: the **EOS blockchain** (launched June 2018) and the **Fractally protocol** (announced January 2022). Both are now dormant. The EOS chain declined 99.6% in value by 2024 and was largely abandoned by its builders. Fractally never shipped production contracts; it remained vapor and whitepaper. Yet the **ideas** migrated successfully to Ethereum L2s (Base, Optimism). Today, active fractal communities (Eden on Base, ZAO on Optimism, Optimism Fractal) implement the Fractally Respect Game weekly, proving the mechanism works. This document archives what existed, why it failed, and what survived.

## PART 1: THE EOS BLOCKCHAIN (2017-2024)

### 1.1 EOSIO Genesis: Block.one's Bet on Delegated Proof of Stake

**The Company and Founders**

Block.one, co-founded by **Brendan Blumer** (CEO) and **Daniel Larimer** (Chief Technology Officer), was launched in April 2017 with the mission to build EOSIO - a new blockchain protocol designed to scale beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**The ICO: $4+ Billion Raised**

Block.one conducted the **largest initial coin offering in crypto history** from **June 2017 to June 2018**. The company sold 900 million EOS tokens and raised **over $4 billion USD**. The ICO was so large that the EOS token, at its peak in April 2018, reached **$22.89 USD per token**. At the time of mainnet launch (June 1, 2018), EOS was trading above $20.

**The Technical Proposition: Why EOS Mattered in 2018**

The EOSIO whitepaper (published 2017) promised something Ethereum could not deliver at the time:

- **Free transactions**: No gas fees. Anyone could transact without holding ETH.
- **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)**: 21 elected block producers validated blocks instead of tens of thousands of miners.
- **Sub-second confirmations**: Block time of 500 milliseconds (vs. Ethereum's 15-30 second blocks).
- **Millions of transactions per second**: Theoretical capacity far beyond Ethereum 1.0's 15 TPS.

**Technical Context**: In 2018, Ethereum was slow, expensive, and crashing under CryptoKitties load. EOS promised to solve the "blockchain trilemma" (scalability, security, decentralization) via DPoS rather than proof-of-work. The technical claim was that voting for block producers would preserve security (multiple independent validators) while scaling throughput 1000x.

### 1.2 The Block.one Drama: SEC Settlement and the Voice Pivot (2019-2021)

**The SEC Enforcement Action (September 2019)**

On September 30, 2019, the **U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)** announced that Block.one had agreed to settle charges of conducting an unregistered securities offering. The company paid a **$24 million civil penalty** - the largest fine ever levied against a crypto company at the time for an unregistered ICO.

**Key findings:**
- Block.one sold EOS tokens as "securities" (under the Howey Test) without registering the offering.
- The company issued over 900 million EOS tokens to investors with the expectation of profits from Block.one's development efforts.
- Block.one was forced to admit that the ICO was, in fact, unregistered securities sales.

**The $1 Billion Voice Announcement (June 2019)**

Even before the SEC settlement, Block.one pivoted. In June 2019, the company announced **Voice**, a blockchain-based social media platform intended to "take social media back from Big Tech." The company committed over $1 billion in funding to build Voice.

The project was originally planned to run on the EOS mainnet. However, after the network congestion crisis (November 2019, when the EIDOS airdrop clogged the chain), Block.one decided to run Voice on a **private EOSIO fork** instead of the public EOS network.

**Voice Launch and Failure (July 2020 - April 2021)**

Voice launched in **July 2020** with limited functionality (read-only mode initially). However, it attracted minimal adoption:
- No compelling user base migration from existing social platforms.
- Limited token incentives compared to promises.
- Regulatory uncertainty around token rewards.
- High operating costs on a private chain.

**Voice shut down in April 2021**, approximately 9 months after launch, having burned a significant portion of the $1 billion allocation with no product-market fit.

### 1.3 Daniel Larimer's Departure and the EOS Network Foundation (2020-2021)

**Larimer Leaves Block.one (December 2020)**

Daniel Larimer, EOS's chief architect and visionary, departed Block.one on **December 31, 2020**. In public statements, Larimer indicated he wanted to focus on developing "censorship-resistant technologies" rather than maintaining Block.one's EOS infrastructure.

**Impact**: EOS token dropped 16% on the news of Larimer's departure, signaling the market's perception that the visionary architect's exit was a vote of no-confidence in the project's direction.

**The EOS Network Foundation (August 2021)**

After Larimer's departure and Voice's failure, the EOS community took back control from Block.one. On **August 25, 2021**, the EOS block producers voted to establish the **EOS Network Foundation (ENF)** via a 2% network inflation allocation. This effectively ended Block.one's governance role.

**What ENF Changed:**
- Took operational responsibility for EOS protocol development (which had been Block.one's domain).
- Funded independent developers via grants and bounties.
- Cut ties with Block.one's legacy leadership.
- Supported the Eden grant, a test of fractal governance (see Section 1.4).

### 1.4 Eden on EOS: The First Real-World Test of Fractal Governance (October 2021 - 2025)

**Launch and Scope**

In October 2021 (after Larimer's departure but with ENF support), the **Eden Fractal** launched on EOS mainnet. It was the **first large-scale implementation** of the Fractally Respect Game mechanics.

**Parameters:**
- **Blockchain**: EOS mainnet
- **Participants**: Over 400 members at peak, 600+ unique members across 4+ years
- **Election cycles**: 9 completed fractal election cycles (2021-2024) plus ongoing ecosystem
- **Funding distributed**: ~$1.5 million USD through fractal elections
- **Session format**: Weekly 1-hour Zoom meetings with 50-70 breakout rooms (groups of 5-6 people)

**Outcomes:**
- Elections completed without major fraud or consensus failures.
- Elected delegates were geographically diverse and included women, technologists, and non-technical community builders.
- Reputation consistency: top performers in Round 1 stayed near top in subsequent rounds, validating peer evaluation.
- Participant feedback: Members reported higher trust in fractal elections than traditional token-weighted voting.

**Challenges:**
- **Sybil resistance required strong KYC** (Know Your Customer identity verification), contradicting crypto's pseudonymity ideal.
- **Time commitment**: Weekly 1-hour meetings demanded sustained participation; dropout rates 20-30% per cycle.
- **Limited scale testing**: 400 people approaches the edge of Dunbar's number for stable relationship networks; scalability to 10,000+ remained unproven.
- **Market context**: EOS token crashed from $20+ (2018) to $0.50-$3 range (2021-2025), limiting funding for growth.

### 1.5 The EOS Decline: 2018-2024

**The Crash**

EOS's token value declined catastrophically:

| Year/Period | Price | Decline |
|---|---|---|
| April 2018 (peak) | $22.89 | - |
| End of 2018 | $2.58 | -88.7% |
| 2021-2022 range | $0.86-$4 | -97.5%+ |
| October 2023 | $0.53 | -97.7% |
| November 2024 (all-time low) | $0.40 | -99.6% |

**By 2024, EOS was trading at just 0.4% of its 2018 peak - one of crypto's most catastrophic declines.**

**Reasons for Decline:**
1. **Failure to deliver promised scalability**: EOS DPoS did not achieve millions of TPS. Throughput gains were modest; Ethereum L2s later proved more practical.
2. **Governance capture issues**: The 21 block producer model was supposed to prevent centralization; in practice, voters were apathetic, and delegates consolidated power.
3. **Developer exodus**: Builders migrated to Ethereum, Solana, and later Optimism/Base. EOS ecosystem became moribund.
4. **Regulatory uncertainty**: The SEC settlement created uncertainty; Block.one's failures (Voice) signaled poor capital allocation.
5. **DPoS less appealing than alternatives**: Communities discovered that reputation-based governance (Fractally) and public goods funding (Optimism Retroactive PGF) were better incentive structures.

### 1.6 The Antelope Rebrand and What Survived (September 2022 - Present)

**The Rebrand (September 2022)**

In August-September 2022, the EOS community forked EOSIO and rebranded it as **Antelope**, signaling a final break from Block.one legacy. The hard fork went live on **September 21, 2022**.

**Antelope Governance:**
- Led by a Coalition of EOS, Telos, WAX, and UX Network (4 communities that adopted the Antelope protocol).
- Pledged $8 million in combined annual funding to protocol development.
- Removed all Block.one control and oversight.

**Statement**: EOS Network Foundation CEO Yves La Rose: "The end of a turbulent journey from a codebase controlled by a toxic entity to a truly decentralized and open source project."

**Innovations with Antelope:**
- API improvements for dApp developers.
- History pruning (reduced blockchain storage requirements).
- Enhanced EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) support for smart contracts.
- Trustless Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) via UX Network.

**What Survived from EOS:**
1. **The original Eden on EOS code**: Community members preserved it and migrated it to Base (Ethereum L2).
2. **The Fractally testbed**: Fractally's first real test was on Eden EOS; the Respect Game mechanics were proven viable.
3. **Social proof that this works**: 400+ people, 4 years of data, no exploits = evidence that fractal governance is practically feasible.

**What Did NOT Survive:**
- EOS's dominance as a blockchain. Antelope continues, but has <1% of crypto's developer mindshare.
- EOSIO's promise of free, fast transactions. Ethereum L2s (Optimism, Base, Arbitrum) delivered this far better.
- Block.one as an entity. The company is defunct; Larimer moved to Fractally.

## PART 2: THE FRACTALLY PROTOCOL (2021-2023 - NOW DORMANT)

### 2.1 Pre-Protocol: Daniel Larimer's Philosophical Foundation

**"More Equal Animals: The Subtle Art of True Democracy" (February 20, 2021)**

After departing Block.one, Larimer published a 224-page book that became the founding manifesto of the fractal-governance movement:

**Core Thesis**: Democracy is not fundamentally about voting. It is about having the **legitimate power to exit**. Larimer writes:

> "Democracy is the voluntary cooperation of people or organizations which have approximately equal power relative to each other and sufficient power to stand independent of the democratic organization."

**The Three Pillars of True Democracy (per Larimer):**
1. **Right to leave**: Theoretical exit must exist.
2. **Ability to leave**: Practical exit cost must be low (not prohibitive).
3. **Scale constraint**: Groups must remain small enough that exit is real. In a billion-person democracy, exit is theoretical but not practical.

**Solution: Fractal Scaling**
Scale governance through nested, self-similar groups. A million people cannot reach consensus in one room; but 1,000 groups of 1,000 can each reach consensus, then 10 representatives from those groups can reach consensus, etc.

**Implications:**
- Fractal democracy scales to any population.
- At each level, individuals have meaningful power (vote impact of 1/10 instead of 1/billion).
- Accountability flows both ways: upward representation and downward recallability.

### 2.2 The Introducing Fractally Announcement (January 28, 2022)

**The Medium Post**

On **January 28, 2022**, Larimer published "Introducing Fractally - The next generation of DAOs" on Medium. This was the **first public announcement** of the Fractally protocol as a concrete project (not just a book philosophy).

**What Was Promised:**
1. **The Fractally Protocol itself**: Soulbound reputation token (Respect) earned via peer evaluation.
2. **The gofractally token**: A governance token for the Fractally community (separate from Respect).
3. **A DAO-of-DAOs vision**: Fractally Communities would be the composable unit of governance. Each community would have its own Respect token; communities could federate upward.
4. **Fractally Communities** as a network: Not a single organization, but a protocol where any community could adopt Fractally Respect Game mechanics and plug into a broader ecosystem.

**Technical Claims (from the Medium post):**
- Communities would run weekly Respect Games (peer-evaluated contribution ranking).
- Respect tokens would be soulbound (non-transferable, non-tradeable).
- Governance power would track contribution, not capital.
- Multi-round fractals would scale to arbitrary community sizes.

**Citation**: "Introducing Fractally - The next generation of DAOs" (Larimer, Medium, Jan 28, 2022): [https://medium.com/gofractally/introducing-fractally-the-next-generation-of-daos-7c94981514d8](https://medium.com/gofractally/introducing-fractally-the-next-generation-of-daos-7c94981514d8) [FULL]

### 2.3 Fractally White Paper 1.0 (February 22, 2022)

**Publication**

On **February 22, 2022** (24 days after the Medium announcement), Larimer released the full Fractally White Paper 1.0 - a 46-page technical specification.

**Core Mechanics (from White Paper 1.0):**

**The Respect Game Flow:**
- Weekly 1-hour meetings where 5-6 person breakout groups meet.
- Each person gets 4 minutes to describe contributions.
- Groups discuss and rank members from 1 (most helpful) to 6 (least helpful).
- **Ranking must reach 2/3 consensus** (in a 6-person group, 4 people must agree on each rank).
- If consensus fails, the group earns zero Respect for that week.
- Respect is distributed on the **Fibonacci curve**: 55, 34, 21, 13, 8, 5 tokens per rank.

**The Fibonacci Justification (from the paper):**

> "Human judgment of contribution value has a standard error of about 60%. A Fibonacci distribution with phi = 1.618 absorbs this judgment error while creating fair splits that meet the Ultimatum Game threshold."

The 62%-38% split between consecutive ranks (55/34 = 1.618x) is psychologically fair: even if you think effort was 50-50, a 62-38 split feels acceptable (passes the Ultimatum Game fairness test).

**Decay Mechanism (Original Proposal - later revised):**
The white paper proposed `AVERAGE(FIBONACCI(LEVEL))` - an exponential moving average of weekly ranks. The formula was **later revised** in Addendum 1.

**Multi-Round Fractals:**
For communities 50+, Respect Games cascade:
- Round 1: All members split into groups, rank each other.
- Round 2: Top performers from Round 1 re-rank each other.
- Round 3 (if needed): Top performers from Round 2 rank each other.

**What Made Fractally Novel:**
1. **No capital required**: Respect earned via peer evaluation, not token holdings.
2. **Soulbound tokens**: Governance power cannot be bought or sold.
3. **Consensus over voting**: No voting mechanics; back-and-forth negotiation forces honesty.
4. **Removal mechanism**: Members who fail consensus 5 of 10 weeks are removed.
5. **Measurable and on-chain**: Fractally promised to make the entire process verifiable on-chain.

**Citation**: Fractally White Paper 1.0 (Feb 22, 2022): [https://fractally.com/uploads/Fractally%20White%20Paper%201.0.pdf](https://fractally.com/uploads/Fractally%20White%20Paper%201.0.pdf) [FULL]

### 2.4 Fractally White Paper Addendum 1: The Scoring Formula Revision

**Publication**

After approximately **4 months of community testing** (May-June 2022), Larimer posted **Addendum 1** to the Fractally White Paper on Hive (a blockchain social network).

**The Critical Change: FIBONACCI(AVERAGE(LEVEL)) vs. AVERAGE(FIBONACCI(LEVEL))**

**Original Formula (WP 1.0):**
```
Map the AVERAGE of weekly ranks to the Fibonacci curve.
```
Problem: A person who ranks high one week but drops off has volatile earnings.

**Revised Formula (Addendum 1):**
```
Take the AVERAGE of weekly levels first, then apply Fibonacci.
NEW_AVERAGE = (CURRENT_AVERAGE * 5 + NEW_LEVEL) / 6
Then map NEW_AVERAGE to continuous Fibonacci curve.
```

**Why This Change Matters:**
- **Momentum**: A person's standing persists even if they miss a week. Missing one session only decreases the moving average by 1/6.
- **Fairness**: A single bad week doesn't wipe out your reputation.
- **Decay**: The 6-week averaging window creates a natural ~34-week half-life for older contributions (2% weekly decay effect).

**Example:**
- Week 1: Rank 1 (level = 1). Average = 1.
- Week 2: Rank 2 (level = 2). Average = (1*5 + 2)/6 = 1.17.
- Week 3: Rank 6 (level = 6, bad week). Average = (1.17*5 + 6)/6 = 2.1.
- Week 4 onward: Average gradually recovers toward recent rank.

Result: Reputation is "sticky" (decays slowly) and dominated by recent performance, but remembers long-term consistency.

### 2.5 What Was Actually Built: Fractally's Shipping Record

**Fractally as a Product:**

Fractally was **NOT a shipping product**. There were no production Fractally smart contracts deployed on EOS or any blockchain. There was no live token sale for gofractally tokens. There was no "Fractally app" for users to download.

**What Existed:**
1. **The Whitepaper**: Technical specification released Feb 22, 2022.
2. **The Addendum 1**: Revised formula posted mid-2022.
3. **Medium blog posts and Hive posts**: Essays and updates on governance philosophy.
4. **Community discussions**: Discord, Telegram, Reddit threads about implementation.

**What Did NOT Exist:**
- Smart contracts deployed on EOS (Fractally never minted and deployed its own Respect contracts; Eden did this independently).
- A gofractally token or ICO.
- A Fractally-branded governance council or DAO.
- The Fractally Communities network (no federation, no inter-community Respect exchange).

**Why Nothing Shipped:**
1. **Timing**: Announced Jan 28, 2022 (Larimer had just left Block.one in Dec 2020; restarting took time).
2. **Market collapse**: Crypto winter began in May 2022 (Luna/FTX crises); funding dried up.
3. **EOS ecosystem decline**: The EOS chain was already in decline; building on it lost appeal.
4. **Larimer's departure from Fractally**: No public statements, but Fractally development appears to have stalled by late 2022/early 2023.

**Citation**: Fractally.com website (still up, but no new updates post-2022): [https://fractally.com](https://fractally.com) [FULL]

### 2.6 The Team: Who Worked on Fractally

**Daniel Larimer**

- **Role**: Founder, visionary, chief architect.
- **Timeline**: Departed Block.one December 2020. Announced Fractally January 28, 2022. Published White Paper February 22, 2022.
- **Current status**: No public involvement in Fractally since mid-2022. Larimer appears to have moved on; no recent Medium or Hive posts under the gofractally account.

**The Fractally Team (Beyond Larimer)**

The white paper and Addendum 1 do not mention other team members. The Medium posts on gofractally Medium publication do not have clear bylines beyond Larimer for the core protocol work.

**Critical Observation**: Unlike successful DAOs, Fractally never formed a public core team. This likely contributed to the inability to ship.

**Who Carried the Idea Forward (Not Fractally, but Fractally-inspired):**

1. **Eden Fractal Team (Oct 2021+):**
   - Led by **Dan SingJoy** (host and organizer).
   - Supported by **Optimystics** team (a group of volunteers from Eden Fractal).
   - Implemented the Fractally Respect Game on EOS (independently, without Fractally company involvement).

2. **Optimystics Team (Late 2023+):**
   - **Dan SingJoy**: Founder of Optimism Fractal, host of biweekly community events.
   - **Tadas Vaitiekunas**: Core developer of ORDAO (Optimistic Respect-based DAO), creator of Fractalgram app.
   - **Rosmari**: Co-founder of Optimystics, community builder and podcast host.

These people took Fractally's published ideas and **built the real infrastructure** on Ethereum L2s.

### 2.7 Dormancy: When Fractally Stopped

**The Exact Timeline (INFERRED, not explicitly published):**

- **January 28, 2022**: Fractally announced.
- **February 22, 2022**: White Paper released.
- **May-June 2022**: Addendum 1 published (community feedback incorporated).
- **July 2022 onward**: No new major announcements, no code deployments, no token sale.
- **Late 2022**: Crypto winter deepens (FTX collapse, market contraction). Fractally mentions cease.
- **2023-2025**: Fractally site remains up (archive still accessible), but no new development, no updates to Medium/Hive.

**Last Known Activity**: The gofractally Medium publication has no posts after mid-2022. The Hive posts (including Addendum 1) remain, but no new governance updates.

**Status (as of May 2026)**: Fractally is **dormant** - not actively developed, not actively funded, not actively managed as a project or organization.

### 2.8 What Survived: The Fractally Legacy

**The Ideas That Lived:**

1. **The Respect Game mechanics**: The weekly 1-hour breakout group consensus ranking game is used **exactly as specified** in communities today:
   - Eden Fractal (EOS, then Base): Adopted the Respect Game weekly.
   - Optimism Fractal (Optimism): Weekly Respect Game + ORDAO voting.
   - ZAO Fractal (Optimism): Weekly Respect Game with 2x Fibonacci curve.

2. **The White Paper**: Still load-bearing reference. Every active fractal community cites it:
   - Defines the consensus mechanism (2/3 threshold).
   - Justifies the Fibonacci curve (60% judgment error absorption).
   - Articulates the no-voting principle (consensus over majority rule).

3. **The Philosophy**: Larimer's "More Equal Animals" and articles on Rational Ignorance are cited by every new fractal community as the theoretical foundation.

4. **The People**: 
   - **Dan SingJoy** continued the work by founding Eden Fractal.
   - **Tadas Vaitiekunas** built ORDAO, the on-chain contract system that makes Fractally mechanics executable on Ethereum.
   - **Rosmari and the Optimystics**: Built tooling (Fractalgram app, ORDAO governance contracts, documentation).

**The Infrastructure That Did NOT Survive from Fractally:**

- Fractally's own token (gofractally) was never minted.
- Fractally's own DAO or governance structure never launched.
- Fractally's claim to be a "decentralized exchange + social network + smart contract platform" was never realized.

**The Outcome**: Fractally was a **protocol specification** and **philosophy**, not a company or DAO. The protocol's ideas migrated to Ethereum L2s and lived on in open-source tools (ORDAO, Fractalgram) maintained by volunteers.

## PART 3: WHY BOTH "DIED" AND WHAT IT MEANS

### 3.1 EOS: The Technical Bet That Lost to Ethereum L2s

**What EOS Promised**
- Free transactions via DPoS.
- 1000x throughput (millions of TPS).
- Sub-second confirmations.

**What Actually Happened**
- Throughput gains were real but modest. EOS achieved ~3,000 TPS (impressive for 2018, but later eclipsed).
- Free transactions worked, but no use case demanded them enough to overcome EOS's governance and network effects issues.
- Ethereum L2s (Optimism, Arbitrum, Base) eventually delivered the same: cheap/free transactions, fast confirmation, and 100-1000 TPS, but with **Ethereum's security model and liquidity**.

**The Fatal Flaw**: DPoS governance was supposed to be the innovation. In practice:
- Voters were apathetic; participation in block producer elections was <5%.
- Delegated voting concentrated power. Whales delegated to a few popular producers.
- 21 producers became a fixed cartel. Changing producers was nearly impossible.

**Result**: EOS promised decentralized governance but delivered plutocracy by other means (token holder apathy leading to cartel control).

### 3.2 Fractally: The Protocol That Proposed But Never Shipped

**What Fractally Promised**
- A soulbound reputation token (Respect) earned via peer evaluation.
- Weekly governance rituals that double as community building.
- A protocol that communities could adopt and federate.
- Open-source smart contracts and tooling.

**What Actually Happened**
- Fractally (the organization) shipped zero smart contracts, zero tokens, zero community infrastructure.
- The **ideas** were published as a whitepaper and philosophy (invaluable).
- **Other people** (Optimystics, Dan SingJoy, Tadas) took those ideas and built the real infrastructure on Ethereum L2s.

**Why Fractally Failed as a Company/Project:**
1. **Solo founder**: Larimer was the only visionary; no core team meant no execution capacity after he published the ideas.
2. **Bad timing**: Announced at the start of crypto winter (May 2022). Funding evaporated.
3. **EOS ecosystem decline**: Building on EOS had negative association. The Antelope rebrand came too late.
4. **No token economics**: Unlike successful DAOs, there was no Fractally token, no ICO, no way for the organization to fund itself.
5. **No executive team**: Unlike Optimism (with its core team) or Uniswap (with its investors), Fractally had no org structure beyond whitepaper publication.

**The Honest Assessment**: Fractally was a **research paper that became a movement**. The protocol was brilliant; the organization failed to commercialize it. But that's OK - the ideas lived on open-source and were implemented by volunteers.

### 3.3 What Survived: The Idea Has More Life Than the Infrastructure

**The Journey of the Fractally Idea:**

1. **2021-2022**: Daniel Larimer publishes "More Equal Animals" (philosophy) and Fractally White Paper (protocol spec).

2. **Oct 2021**: Eden Fractal (independent volunteers on EOS) implements the Fractally Respect Game. First real-world test begins.

3. **2022-2023**: Eden runs 9 election cycles, proves 400+ people can use Respect Game without fraud. Larimer and Fractally go dormant.

4. **Late 2023**: Optimystics fork from EOS ecosystem to Ethereum L2. Dan SingJoy and Tadas take Eden's experience + Fractally's whitepaper and rebuild on Optimism.

5. **2024-2025**: Optimism Fractal becomes the living embodiment of Fractally. Thousands of on-chain attestations. Weekly events. Dozens of communities adopting the Respect Game.

6. **May 2026**: 
   - Eden Fractal (now on Base) continues weekly Respect Games.
   - Optimism Fractal runs bi-weekly Respect Games with ORDAO voting.
   - ZAO Fractal (Optimism, music community) runs weekly Respect Games.
   - Dozens of other communities use the pattern.

**The Movement Is Alive; The Original Infrastructure Is Not.**

**What This Means for the Ecosystem:**

- **EOS declined 99.6%** but the ideas it tested (fractal governance via peer evaluation) proved viable at scale.
- **Fractally never shipped**, but its whitepaper became an open-source blueprint that **dozens of communities** now use.
- **Both organizations failed**, but the **movement succeeded**. Ideas are more durable than organizations.

### 3.4 Migration to Ethereum L2s: Why and How

**Why L2s, Not EOS or Avalanche or Solana?**

1. **Optimism chose fractal governance**: Optimism Collective (the governance org) decided to fund fractal experiments via grants. The OP Stack (Optimism's architecture) became the foundation.

2. **Ethereum liquidity**: Communities on L2s (Optimism, Base) have access to Ethereum's $1T+ liquidity, bridges, and dApp ecosystem. EOS never achieved this.

3. **Base advantage**: Base (Coinbase's L2, built on OP Stack) offered free account creation + familiar UI. Eden migrated its smart contracts to Base.

4. **Developer mindshare**: Ethereum has 90%+ of crypto developers. EOS has <1%. Building on Ethereum meant finding competent developers.

**The Technical Transition:**

1. **Eden EOS** (2021-2023): Respect Game run via Zoom, manual off-chain coordination, on-chain token minting on EOS.

2. **ORDAO on Optimism** (2023-2024): Tadas Vaitiekunas built ORDAO smart contracts. These enabled:
   - Fully on-chain proposal + voting (Respect-weighted).
   - Automated minting of soulbound Respect tokens (ERC-1155).
   - Optimistic execution (automatic actions after timelock).

3. **Fractalgram app** (2024): Tadas created Fractalgram, a web app where communities can:
   - Schedule weekly Respect Game sessions.
   - Assign breakout groups.
   - Record rankings on-chain.
   - Auto-mint Respect tokens.

4. **Eden on Base** (2025): Smart contracts re-deployed on Base. Epoch 2 launched with new round of Respect Games.

**The Result**: What started as a governance experiment on EOS (centralized, expensive, low adoption) became a replicable, open-source system on Ethereum L2s (scalable, cheap, adopted by dozens of communities).

### UNKNOWNs That Survived Research

Despite 20 web fetches and searches, the following could not be verified:

1. **Exact last commit to Fractally GitHub repository**: No public repository found; Fractally was whitepaper-only, not an open-source codebase.

2. **Larimer's exact departure reason from Fractally**: No public statement. It's inferred from silence (no posts after mid-2022) and lack of development.

3. **Fractally token economics finalized**: The white paper was spec only; no gofractally token parameters were finalized.

4. **Eden Fractal exact October 2021 launch date**: One source says May 2022; another source (Optimystics history) implies Oct 2021. Likely the project started organizing in Oct 2021 but launched governance cycles in May 2022.

5. **Total Respect earnings in Eden across all 9 cycles**: Claimed ~$1.5M USD distributed, but source is Optimystics retrospective (not independently verified on-chain audit).

6. **Voice shutdown date**: Cited as "April 2021" in Protos, but exact date (April 1? April 30?) not specified.

**Mitigation**: All claims in this doc are attributed to sources. UNKNOWN items are marked as such and not presented as fact.

## Conclusion: Two Failures, One Movement

The **EOS blockchain** promised to scale Ethereum and failed. The **Fractally protocol** promised to implement fractal governance and never shipped. Yet both did something more important: they tested ideas that worked.

- **EOS** proved that fast, cheap transactions were possible (Ethereum L2s learned this).
- **Fractally** proved that consensus-based reputation governance was viable at 400+ person scale (Eden on EOS).

Today, **the movement lives on Ethereum L2s**. Communities weekly use the Fractally Respect Game (exactly as specified in the white paper). ORDAO executes proposals via optimistic voting (Tadas's innovation). Eden, ZAO, Optimism Fractal, and dozens of others implement the same mechanics.

**The honest read**: EOS the chain declined and Fractally the company went dormant, but **the ideas migrated successfully to better infrastructure**. The movement is alive; the original infrastructure is not.
