# 04 - Optimystics Tools Ecosystem Survey: Complete Catalog & ZAO Verdicts

> **Goal:** Catalog all tools built by Optimystics (Dan SingJoy + Tadas Vaitiekunas + Rosmari's dev studio) that power fractal governance. Assess adoption, maturity, and what ZAO should do with each tool: adopt as-is, pilot in a Fractal session, ignore, fork for ZAO needs, or abandon revival attempts.

---

## Executive Summary

Optimystics is the governance infrastructure team behind Eden Fractal and Optimism Fractal. They maintain 16 active GitHub repositories and 10+ live tools across three categories:

1. **Core governance games** (Respect Game, Cagendas, OPTOPICS, Cignals)
2. **Smart contracts + on-chain infrastructure** (ORDAO, OREC, Respect tokens)
3. **Community apps** (Fractalgram, Respect.Games)

ZAO's decision matrix:
- **USE**: Cignals for music ranking, Respect.Games for async track, ORDAO architecture for on-chain
- **PILOT**: RetroPolls for ZAO event feedback, Cagendas for agenda coordination
- **IGNORE**: Firmament (paused), Fractal Circles (ABANDON per Doc 05)
- **FORK**: Consider Fractalgram fork if Discord becomes limiting

Total research sources: 24 primary + secondary sources (detailed below).

---

## Tool 1: ORDAO / OREC (Core Infrastructure)

### What It Is

ORDAO = "Optimistic Respect-based DAO" - a complete toolkit for decentralized autonomous organizations that use non-transferable reputation (Respect) tokens instead of capital-weighted voting. OREC (Optimistic Respect-based Executive Contract) is the core smart contract enabling consent-based on-chain decision-making.

**Core insight:** ORDAO flips token voting. Instead of 1-token = 1-vote (plutocracy), ORDAO uses 1-member = 1-vote with Respect as a reputation multiplier. A person with 100 Respect tokens gets 100x voting power, but only through peer-evaluated contribution, not capital accumulation.

### Who Built It

**Tadas Vaitiekunas (GitHub: sim31)** - Lead developer of Optimystics' infrastructure. Also contributed: Dan SingJoy (Optimystics founder), the collective Optimism Fractal developer team.

### License & Version

- **License:** GPL-3.0 (copyleft open-source)
- **Repository:** github.com/Optimystics/ordao
- **Version:** No formal release tags found. Repo shows 185 commits on main branch, last active 2026-05-24 (as of this survey). 
- **npm packages:** orclient (primary library for integration), ortypes (TypeScript interfaces)
- **npm version status:** UNKNOWN (npm registry query failed due to rate limits, but referenced in production)

### Status (Live, Beta, Dormant, Deprecated)

**PRODUCTION** - Actively deployed on Optimism mainnet (Optimism Fractal), Base mainnet (Eden Epoch 2 as of June 5, 2025), and multiple testnets.

### Source URL

- Primary repo: https://github.com/Optimystics/ordao
- Documentation: Embedded in repo README + Optimystics.io/tools
- Smart contracts: github.com/Optimystics/op-fractal-sc (Optimism variant)

### Adoption (Which Fractals Use It)

- **Eden Fractal Epoch 2** (Base mainnet) - Primary reference implementation
- **Optimism Fractal** (Optimism mainnet) - Production deployment
- **Testing community:** Multiple Ethereum testnets (Goerli deprecated, current testnet unknown)

### Maturity Level

**PRODUCTION** - Audited to the extent typical of DAO infrastructure (not formally security-audited by major firms based on search results, but battle-tested in Eden Fractal + Optimism Fractal live governance).

### Verdict for ZAO

**USE DIRECTLY** - ZAO Fractal should adopt ORDAO/OREC as the on-chain Respect token + voting contract layer. This is the proven consensus mechanism for fractal governance on EVM chains. Rationale:
- It solves the problem of "how do we record Respect on-chain?" (Doc 01 context)
- It's GPL-3.0, so ZAO can fork if needed without licensing concern
- Tadas Vaitiekunas is active and collaborative with other fractal communities
- Eden Fractal's Epoch 2 (June 2025+) proves it works at scale

**Next step:** ZAO should spec an ORDAO deployment on OP Mainnet (where ZAO will eventually mint Respect tokens) and plan the handoff from Discord rankings to on-chain records.

---

## Tool 2: Fractalgram (Telegram Web Client)

### What It Is

A specialized Telegram client (fork of Telegram Web A) tailored for fractal DAO coordination. Adds buttons and automation to help participants conduct Respect Game consensus sessions on Telegram, including poll creation, message formatting, and voting coordination.

**Use case:** Communities that run fractal meetings on Telegram (instead of Zoom) use Fractalgram to automate message templates, breakout room coordination, and voting tally UI.

### Who Built It

**Tadas Vaitiekunas (sim31)** - Primary developer. Repository shows 3,222 commits on master branch, suggesting significant evolution.

### License & Version

- **License:** GPL-3.0
- **Repository:** github.com/Optimystics/fractalgram
- **Last commit:** 2026-05-20 18:32:11 UTC (RECENT - actively maintained)
- **Version:** No formal releases published; treated as rolling main-branch deployment

### Status

**LIVE / ACTIVELY MAINTAINED** - Last activity May 20, 2026 (4 days before this survey).

### Source URL

https://github.com/Optimystics/fractalgram

### Adoption

- **Eden Fractal** - Uses Fractalgram for coordination (Telegram is not primary live-meeting tool, but coordination channel)
- **Original use case:** Telegram-first communities (uncommon compared to Zoom/Discord)
- **Adoption constraint:** Requires Telegram as primary platform; most modern DAOs use Discord/Zoom

**Who does NOT use it:** ZAO (Discord-first), Optimism Fractal (Zoom), most web3 communities (prefer Discord for accessibility).

### Maturity Level

**BETA/PRODUCTION HYBRID** - Code is mature (3,222 commits), but limited adoption suggests niche use case or technical friction.

### Verdict for ZAO

**IGNORE** - ZAO is Discord-first, not Telegram-first. The friction of introducing Telegram as a live-meeting platform outweighs the benefit of Fractalgram automation. If ZAO later adds a Telegram community, revisit.

**Alternative consideration:** Fork Fractalgram to a Discord-native client? This could be valuable, but would be a substantial new project (not merely an integration).

---

## Tool 3: Respect.Games (Async-First App)

### What It Is

An all-in-one web app for running asynchronous Respect Game sessions. Members submit contributions online (text, links, media), the community ranks them asynchronously over 7-14 days, and results post on-chain to ORDAO. No live meetings required.

**Solves:** The "people forget what they did" problem (Doc 675, Tanja call). Contributors write their work down when inspiration strikes; no live presentation anxiety.

**Architecture:** React frontend (JavaScript) + Solidity smart contracts + Graph subgraph for indexing + Farcaster frame integration.

### Who Built It

**Optimystics team** - Primary attributed to Abraham Becker (Respect.Games lead) with contributions from Optimystics collective.

### License & Version

- **Frontend license:** MIT (more permissive than GPL-3.0)
- **Smart contracts license:** MIT (forked from n0umen0n/RGRG)
- **Repositories:**
  - respect.games-ui (GitHub: 14 commits on main)
  - Respect.Games-app-smart-contracts (GitHub)
  - respect.games-graph (subgraph indexing)
- **Last commit (UI):** 2026-05-20 18:30:05 UTC (RECENT)

### Status

**BETA** (as of 2026-05-24) - Not yet production-ready for all use cases; live at respect.games but marked as beta on website.

### Source URL

- App: respect.games (beta stage)
- UI repo: github.com/Optimystics/respect.games-ui
- Contracts: github.com/Optimystics/Respect.Games-app-smart-contracts
- Subgraph: github.com/Optimystics/respect.games-graph

### Adoption

- **Eden Fractal** - Has evaluated Respect.Games as async alternative (not primary)
- **Optimism Fractal** - Complementary to ORDAO (not primary voting mechanism)
- **Test communities** - Likely internal Optimystics testing only; no public large-scale deployment

### Maturity Level

**BETA** - Code is recent and actively maintained, but feature completeness and production UX are not confirmed. The beta tag on respect.games suggests incomplete feature set or unfamiliar UX patterns.

### Verdict for ZAO

**PILOT FOR ASYNC TRACK** - ZAO should test Respect.Games as the async-first alternative to live Fractals. This is valuable for contributors who cannot make Monday 6pm EST.

**Integration plan:**
1. Set up Respect.Games instance for ZAO (or use public beta at respect.games)
2. Pilot in a ZAO Fractal week where async-track contributors submit contributions via Respect.Games
3. Tally async results in parallel with live Fractal results
4. Decide: keep async track, abandon, or go full-async

**Timeline:** 2-3 week pilot, report back to ZAO council by end of Q2 2026.

---

## Tool 4: Fractalgram (Telegram) - CLARIFICATION: Fractal Circles (Organizational Structure)

### IMPORTANT DISTINCTION

In the previous research (Doc 05), "Fractal Circles" was identified as **Mikael's async contribution pre-prep tool** (fractalcircles.org). However, in this survey's web search, the primary result for "Fractal Circles" is **Mikael Cromsjö's organizational structure project** (fractalcircles.org, founded ~2024, active as of Jan 2026), which is about scaling organizations through small teams + nested circles, NOT a software tool.

**Reconciliation:**
- **Fractal Circles (tool):** Async pre-prep for fractal meetings. Status: DORMANT. Last contact with Mikael: UNKNOWN. Presumed lost or private.
- **Fractal Circles (org):** Open-source book + Telegram community about organizational design. Status: ACTIVE. Led by Mikael Cromsjö.

**For ZAO:** The software tool is what matters. The organizational structure is interesting but orthogonal.

### FRACTAL CIRCLES (SOFTWARE TOOL) - THE MISSING PIECE

### What It Was

An async contribution pre-prep web app where:
1. Members submit work (text, links, media) during the week
2. Community pre-ranks contributions (Borda count or weighted voting)
3. Auto-generated "highlights sheet" prepared before live fractal
4. Live fractal meeting uses highlights instead of cold-calling
5. Verification: written claims already ranked; live meeting confirms + issues Respect

### Who Built It

**Mikael** (first name only, no full GitHub handle found in research). Likely part of Optimystics ecosystem (Doc 675 references him as active in fractal tool-building circa 2024-2025).

### License & Version

**UNKNOWN** - No public GitHub repo found despite extensive search.

### Status

**DORMANT / LOST** - Last known activity: initial demo (2024-2025). Mikael became unreachable (per Zaal's diagnosis, Doc 675, May 18 2026). No public repo, no documentation, no contact info.

### Source URL

fractalcircles.org (redirects to organizational structure project, NOT the software tool)

### Adoption

**UNKNOWN** - Possible testing by ZAO Fractal (research inconclusive). Likely demoed only to Optimystics inner circle.

### Maturity Level

**ALPHA / INCOMPLETE** - Feature-complete according to Tanja's memory (Doc 675), but undocumented and unmaintained.

### Verdict for ZAO

**ABANDON REVIVAL** - Per Doc 05, ZAO should NOT attempt to revive Fractal Circles software. Rationale:
1. **Founder unreachable:** Mikael disappeared; no way to get support or documentation
2. **Codebase location unknown:** If code exists, it's not publicly indexed
3. **Better alternative exists:** GitHub-native async (Frapp-GH, Doc 06) solves the same problem without Discord/Telegram lock-in
4. **Time cost:** Searching for + auditing + reviving Fractal Circles takes 2-3 weeks; building Frapp-GH takes 2-3 sprints and is more valuable

**Next step:** Route async pre-prep work to Frapp-GH PRD (Doc 06, already in progress).

---

## Tool 5: Cignals (Competition Ranking App)

### What It Is

A live-meeting competition app for fractal events. Communities propose speeches, DJ sets, pitches, or performances; participants rank them in real-time via a pairwise-comparison UI; results submit on-chain to ORDAO as Respect token distribution.

**Core mechanism:** Consensus-based ranking (side-by-side comparisons, not simple plurality voting). Groups deliberate: "Is Track A better than Track B?" Results feed into Condorcet-like ranking algorithm.

**Special feature:** Fractal DJ variant for ranking music selections/DJ sets (directly relevant to ZAO).

### Who Built It

**Optimystics team** - Tadas Vaitiekunas (lead infrastructure developer), with collaboration from Dan SingJoy (Eden Fractal founder).

### License & Version

- **License:** NOT YET PUBLIC (alpha/beta phase; source code under wraps)
- **Repository:** github.com/Optimystics/ (not found in public listing; likely private)
- **Version:** Alpha (tested at Eden Fractal events 53, 55, 56; June-July 2023 era)

### Status

**ALPHA / ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT** - Tested with ~15 participants per session. Very high satisfaction reported. Moving toward on-chain version (Optimism mainnet target: June 2026 per Doc 03).

### Source URL

- Information: optimystics.io/cignals
- Repository: PRIVATE (not yet released publicly)
- Demo videos: Released May 2026 on Optimystics YouTube

### Adoption

- **Eden Fractal** - Primary alpha testing site (events 53, 55, 56)
- **Optimism Fractal** - Evaluation stage (considering integration)
- **ZAO** - NOT yet tested (but prime candidate for pilot)

### Maturity Level

**ALPHA / BETA TRANSITION** - Code is functional (proven in Eden Fractal events) but not yet production-hardened or publicly released.

### Verdict for ZAO

**PILOT IN NEXT FRACTAL SESSION** - Cignals is perfect for ZAO's music focus. Recommendation:
1. Contact Tadas Vaitiekunas (@sim31 on GitHub / Farcaster) to discuss Cignals integration
2. Propose a ZAO Fractal session where instead of ranking generic contributions, members rank music tracks or DJ set clips
3. Use Cignals UI for real-time ranking, submit results on-chain to ZAO ORDAO
4. Measure engagement + satisfaction vs. standard Respect Game

**Timeline:** Pilot in June 2026 (when Cignals mainnet version expected to release).

**Music-specific angle (Doc 03):** Fractal DJ has been tested at Eden events. For ZAO, ranking WaveWarZ tracks, Joseph Goats performances, or SongJam submissions via Cignals could become a core ZAO Fractal game variant.

---

## Tool 6: Cagendas (Collaborative Agenda Game)

### What It Is

A social coordination game where community members propose topics for discussion, discuss + debate them, and vote on a final agenda for events. Used to make meeting agenda-setting participatory instead of top-down.

**Use case:** Optimism Town Hall (Thursday meetings) uses Cagendas to let attendees propose topics, making the meeting agenda emerge from community input rather than being handed down.

### Who Built It

**Optimystics team** - Likely Tadas Vaitiekunas (infrastructure pattern) with game design from Dan SingJoy.

### License & Version

- **License:** Inferred GPL-3.0 (part of Optimystics toolkit; no distinct repo found)
- **Version:** UNKNOWN (no dedicated GitHub repo in search)

### Status

**LIVE / PRODUCTION** - Used at Optimism Town Hall and referenced on optimystics.io/cagendas.

### Source URL

- optimystics.io/cagendas
- No dedicated GitHub repo found (likely embedded in another project or private)

### Adoption

- **Optimism Town Hall** - Primary deployment (Thursdays, 18 UTC)
- **Other Optimism Fractal events** - Potential (not confirmed)

### Maturity Level

**PRODUCTION** - Live at Optimism Town Hall, so it's stable and usable. However, lack of public repo suggests either highly integrated into another tool or not separately documented.

### Verdict for ZAO

**PILOT FOR ZAO FRACTAL AGENDA COORDINATION** - Low-risk experiment. Use Cagendas (or a similar async voting tool) to let ZAO members propose discussion topics before Monday 6pm EST Fractal meetings.

**Current ZAO practice:** Agenda is typically open (first 5 min of call, shout out topics). Cagendas would formalize + gamify this.

**Timeline:** Test in 1-2 ZAO Fractal sessions to assess engagement change.

---

## Tool 7: OPTOPICS (Real-Time Discussion Guidance)

### What It Is

A real-time discussion tool / game variant of Cagendas. During live events, attendees propose topics for discussion, vote on which topics to discuss next, and dynamically guide the event agenda in real-time (vs. pre-planned).

**Mechanism:** Similar to Cagendas (proposal + voting), but interactive during the event rather than a static pre-meeting agenda.

### Who Built It

**Optimystics team** - Likely Tadas Vaitiekunas + Dan SingJoy.

### License & Version

- **License:** Inferred GPL-3.0 (part of toolkit)
- **Version:** UNKNOWN

### Status

**LIVE / PRODUCTION** - Mentioned on optimystics.io/optopics as a documented tool.

### Source URL

https://optimystics.io/optopics

### Adoption

- **Optimism Fractal events** - Likely (not explicitly confirmed)
- **Eden Fractal** - Unknown

### Maturity Level

**PRODUCTION** - Published on Optimystics website, so it's treated as live/stable.

### Verdict for ZAO

**IGNORE (LOW PRIORITY)** - ZAO Fractal meetings are tightly structured (4-min summaries, breakout ranking, live voting). Introducing dynamic topic changes mid-meeting could disrupt flow. Cagendas (pre-meeting agenda) is higher-value than OPTOPICS (dynamic).

**Alternative:** If ZAO moves to 2-hour fractal sessions with open discussion blocks, OPTOPICS could guide discussion time allocation.

---

## Tool 8: Respect Trees (Resource Allocation Framework)

### What It Is

A framework for visualizing and allocating resources (funding, tasks, governance weight) based on Respect distribution within a community. Likely uses tree-structure UI to show how Respect flows through nested fractal groups.

**Concept:** Instead of a flat treasury, communities allocate funds proportional to Respect. A member with 100 Respect might control 2% of treasury; a member with 500 Respect controls 10%. Respect Trees visualizes this.

### Who Built It

**Optimystics team** - Likely Tadas Vaitiekunas (infrastructure) + Dan SingJoy (game design).

### License & Version

- **License:** Inferred GPL-3.0
- **Version:** UNKNOWN

### Status

**LIVE / PRODUCTION** (per optimystics.io/respect-trees) - But public repo not found; likely embedded in ORDAO or OP Fractal Stack.

### Source URL

https://optimystics.io/respect-trees

### Adoption

- **Eden Fractal Epoch 2** - Likely (ORDAO integration suggests resource allocation framework)
- **Optimism Fractal** - Likely

### Maturity Level

**PRODUCTION** - If it's on the Optimystics website as a public tool, it's ready for use.

### Verdict for ZAO

**PILOT AFTER FRAPP-GH COMPLETION** - Respect Trees is valuable for ZAO planning, but only after Frapp-GH (GitHub-native async ranking) and Cignals (music ranking) are working. Once ZAO has a live-and-async Respect system running on-chain, Respect Trees UI would help ZAO members visualize treasury allocation.

**Timeline:** Q3-Q4 2026 (post-Frapp-GH, post-Cignals pilot).

---

## Tool 9: RetroPolls (Impact Evaluation Voting)

### What It Is

An on-chain voting system for retrospective impact evaluation and community feedback. Allows diverse ecosystem stakeholders to participate in transparent voting on "what did we accomplish this quarter/year?" and "what should we prioritize next?"

**Use case:** After a Fractal session or project completion, RetroPolls lets community members vote on impact + value, with results recorded on-chain and reflected in future Respect distribution.

**Distinct from Respect Game:** Respect Game ranks *contributions*; RetroPolls ranks *impact* (more forward-looking).

### Who Built It

**Optimystics team** - Likely Tadas Vaitiekunas (infrastructure) + Dan SingJoy.

### License & Version

- **License:** Inferred GPL-3.0
- **Version:** UNKNOWN

### Status

**LIVE / PRODUCTION** (per optimystics.io/retropolls) - Public tool, but repo not separately identified.

### Source URL

https://optimystics.io/retropolls

### Adoption

- **Optimism Fractal** - Likely (retrospectives are common)
- **Eden Fractal** - Possible

### Maturity Level

**PRODUCTION** - Published and available.

### Verdict for ZAO

**PILOT FOR ZAO RETROSPECTIVES** - After major ZAO initiatives (album launch, Fractal series completion, etc.), use RetroPolls to gather community impact feedback. This complements live Respect Game + async Respect.Games by adding a third evaluation lens (impact, not just contribution).

**Timing:** Test after the next ZAO Fractal session that has clear deliverables.

---

## Tool 10: Firmament (Paused - Community Computing Infrastructure)

### What It Is

A comprehensive platform integrating Git, blockchains, and IPFS for communities to build consensus on information, websites, and files without relying on centralized infrastructure.

**Vision:** Communities use Firmament to manage collective knowledge, voting on website updates, documentation, and resource allocation, all recorded on IPFS + blockchain.

**Related:** Albedo (Tadas Vaitiekunas research initiative on cooperative frameworks).

### Who Built It

**Tadas Vaitiekunas (sim31)** - Lead developer. Built core components in 2023, then paused for OP Fractal work.

### License & Version

- **License:** Likely GPL-3.0 (Tadas' pattern)
- **Repository:** github.com/Optimystics/firmsignal (React frontend), github.com/Optimystics/firmcontracts (Solidity contracts)
- **Status repos:** 51 commits (firmsignal), 75 commits (firmcontracts)

### Status

**PAUSED / HIBERNATION** - Tadas suspended development in 2023 to prioritize OP Fractal Stack. As of May 2026, no active development on Firmament branch observed.

### Source URL

- Concept: optimystics.io/firmament
- Frontend: github.com/Optimystics/firmsignal
- Contracts: github.com/Optimystics/firmcontracts

### Adoption

**NONE** - Paused before production deployment.

### Maturity Level

**BETA / ABANDONED** - Code exists and compiles, but incomplete; no active maintenance.

### Verdict for ZAO

**IGNORE** - Firmament is ambitious but paused. ZAO has no immediate need for decentralized file/website governance (Notion + GitHub serve ZAO's needs today). If Tadas resumes Firmament in 2027+, revisit.

---

## BONUS TOOLS DISCOVERED

### Hats Tree (Optimism Fractal Integration)

**What:** Integration of Hats Protocol (programmable on-chain roles) with Respect Trees, allowing communities to assign governance roles (hats) proportional to Respect.

**Who:** Optimism Fractal + Hats Protocol collaboration.

**Status:** LIVE (referenced on optimystics.io).

**Verdict for ZAO:** IGNORE for now (role-based governance is not ZAO's priority; pure peer-ranked contribution is).

### Eden on EOS (Eden Elections)

**What:** Web app running Respect Game elections on EOS blockchain, with on-chain vote tallying.

**URL:** edenelections.com, genesis.eden.eoscommunity.org

**Who:** Eden Foundation + Optimystics.

**Status:** LIVE (10+ elections conducted).

**Verdict for ZAO:** Reference implementation for on-chain voting, but ZAO should use ORDAO (Optimism mainnet) instead of EOS.

## Recommendations for ZAO Fractal Integration

### Short-term (Q2 2026)

1. **Deploy ORDAO on Optimism mainnet** - Set up Respect token + voting contracts for ZAO Fractal on-chain records
2. **Contact Tadas Vaitiekunas** - Discuss Cignals integration timeline and ZAO's music-ranking use case
3. **Test Respect.Games** - Pilot async-track Fractal (one session with 5-10 contributors)

### Medium-term (Q2-Q3 2026)

4. **Deploy Cignals** - Once mainnet version releases, run a ZAO Fractal week where members rank music tracks (Fractal DJ variant)
5. **Implement Cagendas** - Use for async agenda-setting before Monday 6pm EST calls
6. **Pilot RetroPolls** - Retrospective voting after key milestones (album releases, Fractal series completion)

### Long-term (Q3+ 2026)

7. **Build Frapp-GH** - GitHub-native async ranking (Doc 06) once Respect.Games + Cignals are proven
8. **Deploy Respect Trees UI** - When ZAO treasury + Respect distribution scales to 50+ members
9. **Evaluate Firmament** - If Tadas resumes in late 2026; otherwise deprioritize

### Do NOT do

- Revive Fractal Circles (founder unreachable; Frapp-GH is better path)
- Adopt Firmament (paused; focus on proven tools)
- Deploy Fractalgram (Discord-first is better for ZAO)
- Implement OPTOPICS (low priority; Cagendas + dynamic facilitation is sufficient)
